/// @brief      Wraps a closure that is invoked in the destructor unless
///             released by the caller.
///
///             This is especially useful in dealing with APIs that return a
///             resource by accepting ownership of a sub-resource and a closure
///             that releases that resource. When such APIs are chained, each
///             link in the chain must check that the next member in the chain
///             has accepted the resource. If not, it must invoke the closure
///             eagerly. Not doing this results in a resource leak in the
///             erroneous case. Using this wrapper, the closure can be released
///             once the next call in the chain has successfully accepted
///             ownership of the resource. If not, the closure gets invoked
///             automatically at the end of the scope. This covers the cases
///             where there are early returns as well.
