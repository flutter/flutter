// returns to the unsignaled state after unblocking one waiter. (This is similar

// auto-reset |base::WaitableEvent|. However, there are some limitations -- see

  // and the event will be returned to the unsignaled state.
  //
  // Notes (these are arguably bugs, but not worth working around):
  // * That |Wait()| may be one that occurs on the calling thread, *after* the
  //   call to |Signal()|.
  // * A |Signal()|, followed by a |Reset()|, may cause *no* waiting thread to
  //   be unblocked.
  // * We rely on pthreads's queueing for picking which waiting thread to
  //   unblock, rather than enforcing FIFO ordering.
