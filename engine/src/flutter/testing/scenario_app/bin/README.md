# Scenario App Android Test Runner

This directory contains code specific to running Android integration tests.

The tests are uploaded and run on the device using `adb`, and screenshots are
captured and compared using Skia Gold (if available, for example on CI).

See [running the tests](../android/README.md#running-the-tests) for more information.
