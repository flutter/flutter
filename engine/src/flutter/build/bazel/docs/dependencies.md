# Dependencies: how they reach Bazel, and how to add one

## How dependencies reach Bazel during the transition

`gclient sync` stays the only fetcher. Every source dependency is exposed as a
`synced_repository` whose contents are symlinks into the checkout, so GN and
Bazel compile identical trees and nothing is stored twice. Upstream Bazel
files are used where they are maintained and flag-compatible (`googletest`,
`abseil-cpp`); everything else gets an overlay. An overlay replaces the
upstream root `BUILD` file and hides upstream `BUILD` files in subdirectories
(ICU ships some for its data-generation tools), so the overlay's globs can
span the whole tree. Engine code includes such dependencies as it always
has, by either the canonical path (`absl/...`, `unicode/...`) or the
engine's root-relative one (`third_party/abseil-cpp/absl/...`,
`third_party/icu/source/common/unicode/...`, which GN's root include
directory resolves): a `root_includes` library in the abseil tree's and
ICU's overlays is a view of the same headers under that prefix
(`include_prefix`), carried by ICU's libraries and listed by the converter
beside every abseil dependency -- no engine include changes for Bazel.

Prebuilt tools (clang, gn, ninja, ...) default to the synced copy as well. Set

```
FLUTTER_BAZEL_FETCH_TOOLCHAINS=1   # e.g. bazelisk build --repo_env=FLUTTER_BAZEL_FETCH_TOOLCHAINS=1 ...
```

to have Bazel download them from CIPD at the `DEPS` pins instead; the
repository layout is the same either way. This is the path a checkout without
`gclient` will use once the switch is complete. The download is the exact
package file `gclient` installs (verified byte-for-byte for clang, gn and
ninja on linux-x64), served as a zip by
`https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/dl/<package>/+/<version>`.

A CIPD instance id is `base64url(sha256(zip) + 0x02)`, so the sha256 Bazel
needs to verify (and cache) a download can be read off the instance id that
`gclient sync` writes to `<path>/.versions/<name>.cipd_version` (or, for
packages without one, to `.cipd/pkgs/<n>/_current` next to `DEPS`), without
downloading anything. Known hashes live in `_CIPD_SHA256` in `extensions.bzl`;
for an unknown pin Bazel still fetches and prints the hash to add.

Every tool is a `DEPS` entry, `@cpython3` included: the hermetic Python
`engine/src/.gn` names as GN's `script_executable` (DEPS'
`engine/src/flutter/third_party/cpython3`) is the interpreter for the
Python scripts that wrapped GN builds and the converted actions run, so no
Bazel action reaches for depot_tools' `vpython3` or the machine's `python3`.

## Adding a dependency

1. Make sure `deps.lock.bzl` is current (`gen_deps.dart --check`).
2. Add an entry to `_SOURCE_REPOSITORIES` or `_TOOL_REPOSITORIES` in
   `extensions.bzl`, pointing at the `DEPS` path (sysroots go in
   `_SYSROOT_REPOSITORIES`, keyed by their `sysroots.json` entry), and the
   sha256 of its CIPD zip to `_CIPD_SHA256` so a download is verified.
3. If upstream has no usable Bazel files, add `third_party/<name>/BUILD.<name>.bazel`,
   starting its `copts` from `FLUTTER_THIRD_PARTY_COPTS` and adding the `-Wno-*`
   flags its `BUILD.gn` uses.
4. Add the repository name to `use_repo(synced_deps, ...)` in the root `MODULE.bazel`.
