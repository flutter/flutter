# TODO(flutter/flutter#85356): This file was originally generated by the

# copied to the flutter repo to support `dart_library` targets used for
# Flutter-Fuchsia integration tests. This file can be maintained by hand, but it
# would be better to implement a script for Flutter, to either generate these
# BUILD.gn files or dynamically generate the GN targets.
