  /// * `decorationThickness`: The thickness of the decoration as a multiplier on the thickness specified by the font.
  /// * `fontWeight`: The typeface thickness to use when painting the text (e.g., bold).
  /// * `fontStyle`: The typeface variant to use when drawing the letters (e.g., italics).
  /// * `fontFamily`: The name of the font to use when painting the text (e.g., Roboto). If a `fontFamilyFallback` is

  /// * `textAlign`: The alignment of the text within the lines of the

  ///   alignment is applied to that line after it has been truncated but before
  ///   the ellipsis has been added.
  ///   See: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/9819
  ///
  /// * `textDirection`: The directionality of the text, left-to-right (e.g.
  ///   Norwegian) or right-to-left (e.g. Hebrew). This controls the overall
  ///   directionality of the paragraph, as well as the meaning of
  ///   [TextAlign.start] and [TextAlign.end] in the `textAlign` field.
  ///
  /// * `maxLines`: The maximum number of lines painted. Lines beyond this
  ///   number are silently dropped. For example, if `maxLines` is 1, then only
  ///   one line is rendered. If `maxLines` is null, but `ellipsis` is not null,
  ///   then lines after the first one that overflows the width constraints are

  ///
  /// * `fontFamily`: The name of the font family to apply when painting the text,
  ///   in the absence of a `textStyle` being attached to the span.
  ///
  /// * `fontSize`: The fallback size of glyphs (in logical pixels) to
  ///   use when painting the text. This is used when there is no [TextStyle].
  ///
  /// * `height`: The fallback height of the spans as a multiplier of the font
  ///   size. The fallback height is used when no height is provided through
  ///   [TextStyle.height]. Omitting `height` here and in [TextStyle] will allow
  ///   the line height to take the height as defined by the font, which may not
  ///   be exactly the height of the `fontSize`.
  ///
  /// * `textHeightBehavior`: Specifies how the `height` multiplier is
  ///   applied to ascent of the first line and the descent of the last line.
  ///
  /// * `leadingDistribution`: Specifies how the extra vertical space added by
  ///   the `height` multiplier should be distributed over and under the text.
  ///   Defaults to [TextLeadingDistribution.proportional].
  ///
  /// * `fontWeight`: The typeface thickness to use when painting the text
  ///   (e.g., bold).
  ///
  /// * `fontStyle`: The typeface variant to use when drawing the letters (e.g.,
  ///   italics).
  ///
  /// * `strutStyle`: The properties of the strut. Strut defines a set of minimum
  ///   vertical line height related metrics and can be used to obtain more
  ///   advanced line spacing behavior.
  ///
  /// * `ellipsis`: String used to ellipsize overflowing text. If `maxLines` is
  ///   not null, then the `ellipsis`, if any, is applied to the last rendered
  ///   line, if that line overflows the width constraints. If `maxLines` is
  ///   null, then the `ellipsis` is applied to the first line that overflows
  ///   the width constraints, and subsequent lines are dropped. The width
  ///   constraints are those set in the [ParagraphConstraints] object passed to
  ///   the [Paragraph.layout] method. The empty string and the null value are

/// A direction in which text flows.
///
/// Some languages are written from the left to the right (for example, English,
/// Tamil, or Chinese), while others are written from the right to the left (for
/// example Aramaic, Hebrew, or Urdu). Some are also written in a mixture, for
/// example Arabic is mostly written right-to-left, with numerals written
/// left-to-right.
///
/// The text direction must be provided to APIs that render text or lay out
/// boxes horizontally, so that they can determine which direction to start in:
/// either right-to-left, [TextDirection.rtl]; or left-to-right,
/// [TextDirection.ltr].
///
/// ## Design discussion
///
/// Flutter is designed to address the needs of applications written in any of
/// the world's currently-used languages, whether they use a right-to-left or
/// left-to-right writing direction. Flutter does not support other writing
/// modes, such as vertical text or boustrophedon text, as these are rarely used
/// in computer programs.
///
/// It is common when developing user interface frameworks to pick a default
/// text direction — typically left-to-right, the direction most familiar to the
/// engineers working on the framework — because this simplifies the development
/// of applications on the platform. Unfortunately, this frequently results in
/// the platform having unexpected left-to-right biases or assumptions, as
/// engineers will typically miss places where they need to support
/// right-to-left text. This then results in bugs that only manifest in
/// right-to-left environments.
///
/// In an effort to minimize the extent to which Flutter experiences this
/// category of issues, the lowest levels of the Flutter framework do not have a
/// default text reading direction. Any time a reading direction is necessary,
/// for example when text is to be displayed, or when a
/// writing-direction-dependent value is to be interpreted, the reading
/// direction must be explicitly specified. Where possible, such as in `switch`
/// statements, the right-to-left case is listed first, to avoid the impression
/// that it is an afterthought.
///
/// At the higher levels (specifically starting at the widgets library), an
/// ambient [Directionality] is introduced, which provides a default. Thus, for
/// instance, a [Text] widget in the scope of a [MaterialApp] widget does not
/// need to be given an explicit writing direction. The [Directionality.of]
/// static method can be used to obtain the ambient text direction for a
/// particular [BuildContext].
///
/// ### Known left-to-right biases in Flutter
///
/// Despite the design intent described above, certain left-to-right biases have
/// nonetheless crept into Flutter's design. These include:
///
///  * The [Canvas] origin is at the top left, and the x-axis increases in a
///    left-to-right direction.
///
///  * The default localization in the widgets and material libraries is
///    American English, which is left-to-right.
///
/// ### Visual properties vs directional properties
///
/// Many classes in the Flutter framework are offered in two versions, a
/// visually-oriented variant, and a text-direction-dependent variant. For
/// example, [EdgeInsets] is described in terms of top, left, right, and bottom,
/// while [EdgeInsetsDirectional] is described in terms of top, start, end, and
/// bottom, where start and end correspond to right and left in right-to-left
/// text and left and right in left-to-right text.
///
/// There are distinct use cases for each of these variants.
///
/// Text-direction-dependent variants are useful when developing user interfaces
/// that should "flip" with the text direction. For example, a paragraph of text
/// in English will typically be left-aligned and a quote will be indented from
/// the left, while in Arabic it will be right-aligned and indented from the
/// right. Both of these cases are described by the direction-dependent
/// [TextAlign.start] and [EdgeInsetsDirectional.start].
///
/// In contrast, the visual variants are useful when the text direction is known
/// and not affected by the reading direction. For example, an application
/// giving driving directions might show a "turn left" arrow on the left and a
/// "turn right" arrow on the right — and would do so whether the application
/// was localized to French (left-to-right) or Hebrew (right-to-left).
///
/// In practice, it is also expected that many developers will only be
/// targeting one language, and in that case it may be simpler to think in
/// visual terms.
// The order of this enum must match the order of the values in TextDirection.h's TextDirection.

  /// Adds an inline placeholder space to the paragraph.
  ///
  /// The paragraph will contain a rectangular space with no text of the dimensions
  /// specified.
  ///
  /// The `width` and `height` parameters specify the size of the placeholder rectangle.
  ///
  /// The `alignment` parameter specifies how the placeholder rectangle will be vertically
  /// aligned with the surrounding text. When [PlaceholderAlignment.baseline],
  /// [PlaceholderAlignment.aboveBaseline], and [PlaceholderAlignment.belowBaseline]
  /// alignment modes are used, the baseline needs to be set with the `baseline`.
  /// When using [PlaceholderAlignment.baseline], `baselineOffset` indicates the distance
  /// of the baseline down from the top of the rectangle. The default `baselineOffset`
  /// is the `height`.
  ///
  /// Examples:
  ///
  /// * For a 30x50 placeholder with the bottom edge aligned with the bottom of the text, use:
  /// `addPlaceholder(30, 50, PlaceholderAlignment.bottom);`
  /// * For a 30x50 placeholder that is vertically centered around the text, use:
  /// `addPlaceholder(30, 50, PlaceholderAlignment.middle);`.
  /// * For a 30x50 placeholder that sits completely on top of the alphabetic baseline, use:
  /// `addPlaceholder(30, 50, PlaceholderAlignment.aboveBaseline, baseline: TextBaseline.alphabetic)`.
  /// * For a 30x50 placeholder with 40 pixels above and 10 pixels below the alphabetic baseline, use:
  /// `addPlaceholder(30, 50, PlaceholderAlignment.baseline, baseline: TextBaseline.alphabetic, baselineOffset: 40)`.
  ///
  /// Lines are permitted to break around each placeholder.
  ///
  /// Decorations will be drawn based on the font defined in the most recently
  /// pushed [TextStyle]. The decorations are drawn as if unicode text were present
  /// in the placeholder space, and will draw the same regardless of the height and
  /// alignment of the placeholder. To hide or manually adjust decorations to fit,
  /// a text style with the desired decoration behavior should be pushed before
  /// adding a placeholder.
  ///
  /// Any decorations drawn through a placeholder will exist on the same canvas/layer
  /// as the text. This means any content drawn on top of the space reserved by
  /// the placeholder will be drawn over the decoration, possibly obscuring the
  /// decoration.
  ///
  /// Placeholders are represented by a unicode 0xFFFC "object replacement character"
  /// in the text buffer. For each placeholder, one object replacement character is
  /// added on to the text buffer.
  ///
  /// The `scale` parameter will scale the `width` and `height` by the specified amount,
  /// and keep track of the scale. The scales of placeholders added can be accessed
  /// through [placeholderScales]. This is primarily used for accessibility scaling.
