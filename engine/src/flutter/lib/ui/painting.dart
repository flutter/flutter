/// as an 8-bit value), a green [g] channel value of `0.6471` (or `0xA5` or

/// const Color c1 = Color.from(alpha: 1.0, red: 0.2588, green: 0.6471, blue: 0.9608);
/// const Color c2 = Color(0xFF42A5F5);

/// const Color c4 = Color.fromARGB(255, 66, 165, 245);
/// const Color c5 = Color.fromRGBO(66, 165, 245, 1.0);
/// ```
///
/// If you are having a problem with [Color.new] wherein it seems your color is
/// just not painting, check to make sure you are specifying the full 8
/// hexadecimal digits. If you only specify six, then the leading two digits are
/// assumed to be zero, which means fully-transparent:
///
/// ```dart
/// const Color c1 = Color(0xFFFFFF); // fully transparent white (invisible)
/// const Color c2 = Color(0xFFFFFFFF); // fully opaque white (visible)
///
/// // Or use double-based channel values:
/// const Color c3 = Color.from(alpha: 1.0, red: 1.0, green: 1.0, blue: 1.0);

/// and the _destination_, which is the image into which the source image is
/// being composited. The destination is often thought of as the _background_.
/// The source and destination both have four color channels, the red, green,
/// blue, and alpha channels. These are typically represented as numbers in the
/// range 0.0 to 1.0. The output of the algorithm also has these same four
/// channels, with values computed from the source and destination.
///
/// The documentation of each value below describes how the algorithm works. In
/// each case, an image shows the output of blending a source image with a
/// destination image. In the images below, the destination is represented by an
/// image with horizontal lines and an opaque landscape photograph, and the
/// source is represented by an image with vertical lines (the same lines but
/// rotated) and a bird clip-art image. The [src] mode shows only the source
/// image, and the [dst] mode shows only the destination image. In the
/// documentation below, the transparency is illustrated by a checkerboard
/// pattern. The [clear] mode drops both the source and destination, resulting
/// in an output that is entirely transparent (illustrated by a solid
/// checkerboard pattern).
///
/// The horizontal and vertical bars in these images show the red, green, and
/// blue channels with varying opacity levels, then all three color channels
/// together with those same varying opacity levels, then all three color
/// channels set to zero with those varying opacity levels, then two bars showing
/// a red/green/blue repeating gradient, the first with full opacity and the
/// second with partial opacity, and finally a bar with the three color channels
/// set to zero but the opacity varying in a repeating gradient.

  /// applied.
  ///
  /// This lets you create composite effects, for example making a group of
  /// drawing commands semi-transparent. Without using [saveLayer], each part of
  /// the group would be painted individually, so where they overlap would be
  /// darker than where they do not. By using [saveLayer] to group them
  /// together, they can be drawn with an opaque color at first, and then the
  /// entire group can be made transparent using the [saveLayer]'s paint.
  ///
  /// Call [restore] to pop the save stack and apply the paint to the group.
  ///
  /// ## Using saveLayer with clips
  ///
  /// When a rectangular clip operation (from [clipRect]) is not axis-aligned
  /// with the raster buffer, or when the clip operation is not rectilinear
  /// (e.g. because it is a rounded rectangle clip created by [clipRRect] or an
  /// arbitrarily complicated path clip created by [clipPath]), the edge of the
  /// clip needs to be anti-aliased.
  ///
  /// If two draw calls overlap at the edge of such a clipped region, without
  /// using [saveLayer], the first drawing will be anti-aliased with the
  /// background first, and then the second will be anti-aliased with the result
  /// of blending the first drawing and the background. On the other hand, if
  /// [saveLayer] is used immediately after establishing the clip, the second
  /// drawing will cover the first in the layer, and thus the second alone will
  /// be anti-aliased with the background when the layer is clipped and
  /// composited (when [restore] is called).
  ///
  /// For example, this [CustomPainter.paint] method paints a clean white
  /// rounded rectangle:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ///   Rect rect = Offset.zero & size;
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(RRect.fromRectXY(rect, 100.0, 100.0));
  ///   canvas.saveLayer(rect, Paint());
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.red);
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  ///   canvas.restore();
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// On the other hand, this one renders a red outline, the result of the red
  /// paint being anti-aliased with the background at the clip edge, then the
  /// white paint being similarly anti-aliased with the background _including
  /// the clipped red paint_:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ///   // (this example renders poorly, prefer the example above)
  ///   Rect rect = Offset.zero & size;
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(RRect.fromRectXY(rect, 100.0, 100.0));
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.red);
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This point is moot if the clip only clips one draw operation. For example,
  /// the following paint method paints a pair of clean white rounded
  /// rectangles, even though the clips are not done on a separate layer:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(RRect.fromRectXY(Offset.zero & (size / 2.0), 50.0, 50.0));
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(RRect.fromRectXY(size.center(Offset.zero) & (size / 2.0), 50.0, 50.0));
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// (Incidentally, rather than using [clipRRect] and [drawPaint] to draw
  /// rounded rectangles like this, prefer the [drawRRect] method. These
  /// examples are using [drawPaint] as a proxy for "complicated draw operations
  /// that will get clipped", to illustrate the point.)
  ///
  /// ## Performance considerations
  ///
  /// Generally speaking, [saveLayer] is relatively expensive.
  ///
  /// There are a several different hardware architectures for GPUs (graphics
  /// processing units, the hardware that handles graphics), but most of them
  /// involve batching commands and reordering them for performance. When layers
  /// are used, they cause the rendering pipeline to have to switch render
  /// target (from one layer to another). Render target switches can flush the
  /// GPU's command buffer, which typically means that optimizations that one
  /// could get with larger batching are lost. Render target switches also
  /// generate a lot of memory churn because the GPU needs to copy out the
  /// current frame buffer contents from the part of memory that's optimized for
  /// writing, and then needs to copy it back in once the previous render target
  /// (layer) is restored.
  ///

  ///  * [save], which saves the current state, but does not create a new layer

  /// color will be considered the destination.
  /// - Blend the result from the first step onto the canvas using the translation,
  /// rotation, and scale properties expressed in the associated entry in the
  /// [transforms] list using the properties of the [Paint] object.
  ///
  /// If the first stage of the operation which blends each part of the image with
  /// a color is needed, then both the [colors] and [blendMode] arguments must
  /// not be null and there must be an entry in the [colors] list for each
  /// image part. If that stage is not needed, then the [colors] argument can
  /// be either null or an empty list and the [blendMode] argument may also be null.
  ///
  /// The optional [cullRect] argument can provide an estimate of the bounds of the
