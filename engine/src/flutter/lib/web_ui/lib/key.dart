  /// model.

  /// and up events at the down of alternate presses to indicate the direction
  /// in which the lock is toggled instead of that the physical key is going. A
  /// macOS embedder should normalize the behavior by converting a native down
  /// event into a down event followed immediately by a synthesized up event,
  /// and the native up event also into a down event followed immediately by a
  /// synthesized up event.
