//                https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/100394
//                Rather than extending this file with new APIs, we
//                should instead use js interop.

// This file contains extra web-only API that non-web engines do not have.
//
// Why have web-only API?
//
// Because all Dart code is compiled (and tree shaken) as a single compilation
// unit it only has one entry-point - the `main()` function of the Flutter
// app. The top-level `main()` is generated by Flutter tool and it needs to
// ask the engine to initialize itself before calling the handwritten `main()`
// function of the app itself. To do that, it needs something to call. The
// mobile engine doesn't provide a function like that because the application
// starts from the Java (Android) or Objective-C (iOS). Any initial
// configuration can be done in Java and the engine's C++ code prior to
// calling Dart's `main()`.
