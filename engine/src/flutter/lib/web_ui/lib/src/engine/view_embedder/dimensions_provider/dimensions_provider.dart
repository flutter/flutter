/// different sources of information:

/// * [FullPageDimensionsProvider] - The default behavior, uses the VisualViewport
///   API to measure, and react to, the dimensions of the full browser window.
/// * [CustomElementDimensionsProvider] - Uses a custom html Element as the source
///   of dimensions, and the ResizeObserver to notify the app of changes.
///
/// All the measurements returned from this class are potentially *expensive*,
/// and should be cached as needed. Every call to every method on this class
/// WILL perform actual DOM measurements.
