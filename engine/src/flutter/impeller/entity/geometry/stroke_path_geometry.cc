/// StrokePathSegmentReceiver converts path segments (fed by PathTessellator)
/// into a vertex strip that covers the outline of the stroked version of the
/// path and feeds those vertices, expressed in the form of a vertex strip
/// into the supplied PositionWriter.
///
/// The general procedure follows the following basic methodology:
///
/// Every path segment is represented by a box with two starting vertices
/// perpendicular to its start point and two vertices perpendicular to its
/// end point, all perpendiculars of length (stroke_width * 0.5).
///
/// Joins will connect the ending "box" perpendiculars of the previous segment
/// to the starting "box" perpendiculars of the following segment. If the two
/// boxes are so aligned that their adjacent perpendiculars are less than a
/// threshold distance apart (kJoinPixelThreshold), the join will just be
/// elided so that the end of one box becomes the start of the next box.
/// If the join process does add decorations, it assumes that the ending
/// perpendicular vertices from the prior segment are the last vertices
/// added and ensures that it appends the two vertices for the starting
/// perpendiculars of the new segment's "box". Thus every join either
/// adds nothing and the end perpendiculars of the previous segment become
/// the start perpendiculars of the next segment, or it makes sure its
/// geometry fills in the gap and ends with the start perpendiculars for the
/// new segment.
///
/// Prior to the start of an unclosed contour we insert a cap and also the
/// starting perpendicular segments for the first segment. Prior to the
/// start of a closed contour, we just insert the starting perpendiculars
/// for the first segment. Either way, we've initialized the path with the
/// starting perpendiculars of the first segment.
///
/// After the last segment in an unclosed contour we insert a cap which
/// can assume that the last segment has already inserted its closing
/// perpendicular segments. After the last segment in a closed contour, we
/// insert a join back to the very first segment in that contour.
///
/// Connecting any two contours we insert an infinitely thin connecting
/// thread by inserting the last point of the previous contour twice and
/// then inserting the first point of the next contour twice. This ensures
/// that there are no non-empty triangles between the two contours.
///
/// Finally, inserting a line segment can assume that the starting
/// perpendiculars have already been inserted by the preceding cap, join,
/// or prior segment, so all it needs to do is to insert the ending
/// perpendiculars which set the process up for the subsequent cap, join,
/// or future segment.
///
/// Inserting curve segments acts like a series of line segments except
/// that the opening perpendicular is taken from the curve rather than the
/// direction between the starting point and the first sample point. This
/// ensures that any cap or join will be aligned with the curve and not
/// tilted by the first approximating segment. The same is true of the
/// ending perpendicular which is taken from the curve and not the last
/// approximated segment. Between each approximated segment of the curve,
/// we insert only Cap::kRound joins so as not to polygonize a curve when
/// it turns very sharply. We also skip these joins for any change of
/// direction which is smaller than the first sample point of a round join
/// for performance reasons.
///
/// To facilitate all of that work we maintain variables containing
/// SeparatedVector2 values that, by convention, point 90 degrees to the
/// right of the given path direction. This facilitates a quick add/subtract
/// from the point on the path to insert the necessary perpendicular
/// points of a segment's box. These values contain both a unit vector for
/// direction and a magnitude for length.
///
/// SeparatedVector2 values also allow us to quickly test limits on when to
/// include joins by using a simple dot product on the previous and next
/// perpendiculars at a given path point which should match the dot product
/// of the path's direction itself at the same point since both perpendiculars
/// have been rotated identically to the same side of the path.
/// The SeparatedVector2 will perform the dot product on the unit-length
/// vectors so that the result is exactly the cosine of the angle between the
/// segments - also the angle by which the path turned at a given path point.
