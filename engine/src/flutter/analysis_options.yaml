# Specify analysis options.
#
# This file is a copy of analysis_options_repo.yaml from flutter repo
# as of 2018-05-30, but with:
#  - "always_require_non_null_named_parameters" disabled (because we
#    can't import the meta package from the SDK), and
#  - "sort_constructors_first" disabled (because we have private fake
#     constructors),
#  - "prefer_final_fields" disabled (because we do weird things with
#    private fields, especially on the PlatformDispatcher object):
