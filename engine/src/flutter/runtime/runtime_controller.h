  /// NotifyIdle is advisory. The VM may or may not run a garbage collection
  /// when this is called, and will eventually perform garbage collections even
  /// if it is not called or it is called with insufficient deadlines.
  ///
  /// The garbage collection mechanism and its thresholds are internal
  /// implementation details and absolutely no guarantees are made about the
  /// threshold discussed below. This discussion is also an oversimplification
  /// but hopefully serves to calibrate expectations about GC behavior:
  /// * When the Dart VM and its root isolate are initialized, the memory
  ///   consumed upto that point are treated as a baseline.
  /// * A fixed percentage of the memory consumed (~20%) over the baseline is
  ///   treated as the hard threshold.
  /// * The memory in play is divided into old space and new space. The new
  ///   space is typically very small and fills up rapidly.
  /// * The baseline plus the threshold is considered the old space while the
  ///   small new space is a separate region (typically a few pages).
  /// * The total old space size minus the max new space size is treated as the
  ///   soft threshold.
  /// * In a world where there is no call to NotifyIdle, when the total
  ///   allocation exceeds the soft threshold, a concurrent mark is initiated in
  ///   the VM. There is a “small” pause that occurs when the concurrent mark is
  ///   initiated and another pause when the mark concludes and a sweep is
  ///   initiated.
  /// * If the total allocations exceeds the hard threshold, a “big”
  ///   stop-the-world pause is initiated.
  /// * If after either the sweep after the concurrent mark, or, the
  ///   stop-the-world pause, the consumption returns to be below the soft
  ///   threshold, the dance begins anew.
  /// * If after both the “small” and “big” pauses, memory usage is still over
  ///   the hard threshold, i.e, the objects are still reachable, that amount of
  ///   memory is treated as the new baseline and a fixed percentage of the new
  ///   baseline over the new baseline is now the new hard threshold.
  /// * Updating the baseline will continue till memory for the updated old
  ///   space can be allocated from the operating system. These allocations will
  ///   typically fail due to address space exhaustion on 32-bit systems and
  ///   page table exhaustion on 64-bit systems.
  /// * NotifyIdle initiates the concurrent mark preemptively. The deadline is
  ///   used by the VM to determine if the corresponding sweep can be performed
  ///   within the deadline. This way, jank due to “small” pauses can be
  ///   ameliorated.
  /// * There is no ability to stop a “big” pause on reaching the hard threshold
  ///   in the old space. The best you can do is release (by making them
  ///   unreachable) objects eagerly so that the are marked as unreachable in
  ///   the concurrent mark initiated by either reaching the soft threshold or
  ///   an explicit NotifyIdle.
  /// * If you are running out of memory, its because too many large objects
  ///   were allocation and remained reachable such that the old space kept
  ///   growing till it could grow no more.
