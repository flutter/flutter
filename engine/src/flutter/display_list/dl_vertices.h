/// There are 4 main pices of data:
///   - vertices():
///       the points on the rendering surface that define the pixels
///       being rendered to in a series of triangles. These points
///       can map to triangles in various ways depending on the
///       supplied |DlVertexMode|.
///   - texture_coordinates():
///       the points in the DlColorSource to map to the coordinates
///       of the triangles in the vertices(). If missing, the
///       vertex coordinates themselves will be used to map the
///       source colors to the vertices.
///   - colors():
///       colors to map to each triangle vertex. Note that each
///       vertex is mapped to exactly 1 color even if the DlVertex
///   - indices():
///       An indirection based on indices into the array of vertices
///       (and by extension, their associated texture_coordinates and
///       colors). Note that the DLVertexMode will still apply to the
///       indices in the same way (and instead of the way) that it
///       would normally be applied to the vertices themselves. The
///       indices are useful, for example, to fill the vertices with
///       a grid of points and then use the indices to define a
///       triangular mesh that covers that grid without having to
///       repeat the vertex (and texture coordinate and color)
///       information for the times when a given grid coordinate
///       gets reused in up to 4 mesh triangles.
///
/// Note that each vertex is mapped to exactly 1 texture_coordinate and
/// color even if the DlVertexMode or indices specify that it contributes
/// to more than one output triangle.
