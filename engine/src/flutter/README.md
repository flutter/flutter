Flutter Engine
==============

[![Build Status - Cirrus][]][Build status]

Flutter is Google's mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces
in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and
organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

The Flutter Engine is a portable runtime for hosting
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) applications.  It implements Flutter's core
libraries, including animation and graphics, file and network I/O,
accessibility support, plugin architecture, and a Dart runtime and compile
toolchain. Most developers will interact with Flutter via the [Flutter
Framework](https://github.com/flutter/flutter), which provides a modern,
reactive framework, and a rich set of platform, layout and foundation widgets.

This is a tool written to make web engine development experience easy.

on the Flutter project, including tutorials and samples, on our Web
site at [Flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev). For specific information
