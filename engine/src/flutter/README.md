Flutter Engine
==============
[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/flutter/engine.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/flutter/engine)

Flutter is a new way to build high-performance, cross-platform mobile apps.
Flutter is optimized for today's, and tomorrow's, mobile devices. We are
focused on low-latency input and high frame rates on Android and iOS.

The Flutter Engine is a portable runtime for hosting
[Flutter](https://flutter.io) applications.  It implements Flutter's core
libraries, including animation and graphics, file and network I/O,
accessibility support, plugin architecture, and a Dart runtime and compile
toolchain. Most developers will interact with Flutter via the [Flutter
Framework](https://github.com/flutter/flutter), which provides a modern,
reactive framework, and a rich set of platform, layout and foundation widgets.


_Flutter is still under development and we continue to add 
features._ However, it is ready for use by early adopters who are willing to deal
with the odd wrinkle or two along the way.  We hope you try it out and send
us [feedback](mailto:flutter-dev@googlegroups.com).
