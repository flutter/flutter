/**
 * Interface to be implemented by all Flutter plugins.
 *
 * <p>A Flutter plugin allows Flutter developers to interact with a host platform, e.g., Android and
 * iOS, via Dart code. It includes platform code, as well as Dart code. A plugin author is
 * responsible for setting up an appropriate {@link io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodChannel} to
 * communicate between platform code and Dart code.
 *
 * <p>A Flutter plugin has a lifecycle. First, a developer must add a {@code FlutterPlugin} to an
 * instance of {@link io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine}. To do this, obtain a {@link
 * PluginRegistry} with {@link FlutterEngine#getPlugins()}, then call {@link
 * PluginRegistry#add(FlutterPlugin)}, passing the instance of the Flutter plugin. During the call
 * to {@link PluginRegistry#add(FlutterPlugin)}, the {@link
 * io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine} will invoke {@link
 * #onAttachedToEngine(FlutterPluginBinding)} on the given {@code FlutterPlugin}. If the {@code
 * FlutterPlugin} is removed from the {@link io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine} via {@link
 * PluginRegistry#remove(Class)}, or if the {@link io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine} is
 * destroyed, the {@link FlutterEngine} will invoke {@link
 * FlutterPlugin#onDetachedFromEngine(FlutterPluginBinding)} on the given {@code FlutterPlugin}.
 *
 * <p>Once a {@code FlutterPlugin} is attached to a {@link
 * io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine}, the plugin's code is permitted to access and invoke
 * methods on resources within the {@link FlutterPluginBinding} that the {@link
 * io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine} gave to the {@code FlutterPlugin} in {@link
 * #onAttachedToEngine(FlutterPluginBinding)}. This includes, for example, the application {@link
 * Context} for the running app.
 *
 * <p>The {@link FlutterPluginBinding} provided in {@link #onAttachedToEngine(FlutterPluginBinding)}
 * is no longer valid after the execution of {@link #onDetachedFromEngine(FlutterPluginBinding)}. Do
 * not access any properties of the {@link FlutterPluginBinding} after the completion of {@link
 * #onDetachedFromEngine(FlutterPluginBinding)}.
 *
 * <p>To register a {@link io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodChannel}, obtain a {@link BinaryMessenger}
 * via the {@link FlutterPluginBinding}.
 *
 * <p>An Android Flutter plugin may require access to app resources or other artifacts that can only
 * be retrieved through a {@link Context}. Developers can access the application context via {@link
 * FlutterPluginBinding#getApplicationContext()}.
 *
 * <p>Some plugins may require access to the {@code Activity} that is displaying a Flutter
 * experience, or may need to react to {@code Activity} lifecycle events, e.g., {@code onCreate()},
 * {@code onStart()}, {@code onResume()}, {@code onPause()}, {@code onStop()}, {@code onDestroy()}.
 * Any such plugin should implement {@link
 * io.flutter.embedding.engine.plugins.activity.ActivityAware} in addition to implementing {@code
 * FlutterPlugin}. {@code ActivityAware} provides callback hooks that expose access to an associated
 * {@code Activity} and its {@code Lifecycle}. All plugins must respect the possibility that a
 * Flutter experience may never be associated with an {@code Activity}, e.g., when Flutter is used
 * for background behavior. Additionally, all plugins must respect that a {@code Activity}s may come
 * and go over time, thus requiring plugins to cleanup resources and recreate those resources as the
 * {@code Activity} comes and goes.
