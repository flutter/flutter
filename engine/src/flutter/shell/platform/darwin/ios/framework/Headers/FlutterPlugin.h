 A registry of Flutter iOS plugins.

 Plugins are identified by unique string keys, typically the name of the
 plugin's main class. The registry tracks plugins by this key, mapping it to
 a value published by the plugin during registration, if any. This provides a
 very basic means of cross-plugin coordination with loose coupling between
 unrelated plugins.

 Plugins typically need contextual information and the ability to register
 callbacks for various application events. To keep the API of the registry
 focused, these facilities are not provided directly by the registry, but by
 a `FlutterPluginRegistrar`, created by the registry in exchange for the unique
 key of the plugin.

 There is no implied connection between the registry and the registrar.
 Specifically, callbacks registered by the plugin via the registrar may be
 relayed directly to the underlying iOS application objects.
