// This file defines an Application Binary Interface (ABI), which requires more
// stability than regular code to remain functional for exchanging messages
// between different versions of the embedding and the engine, to allow for both
// forward and backward compatibility.
//
// Specifically,
// - The order, type, and size of the struct members below must remain the same,
//   and members should not be removed.
// - New structures that are part of the ABI must be defined with "size_t
//   struct_size;" as their first member, which should be initialized using
//   "sizeof(Type)".
// - Enum values must not change or be removed.
// - Enum members without explicit values must not be reordered.
// - Function signatures (names, argument counts, argument order, and argument
//   type) cannot change.
// - The core behavior of existing functions cannot change.
// - Instead of nesting structures by value within another structure/union,
//   prefer nesting by pointer. This ensures that adding members to the nested
//   struct does not break the ABI of the parent struct/union.
// - Instead of array of structures, prefer array of pointers to structures.
//   This ensures that array indexing does not break if members are added
//   to the structure.
//
// These changes are allowed:
// - Adding new struct members at the end of a structure as long as the struct
//   is not nested within another struct by value.
// - Adding new enum members with a new value.
// - Renaming a struct member as long as its type, size, and intent remain the
//   same.
// - Renaming an enum member as long as its value and intent remains the same.
//
// It is expected that struct members and implicitly-valued enums will not
// always be declared in an order that is optimal for the reader, since members
// will be added over time, and they can't be reordered.
//
// Existing functions should continue to appear from the caller's point of view
// to operate as they did when they were first introduced, so introduce a new
// function instead of modifying the core behavior of a function (and continue
// to support the existing function with the previous behavior).
