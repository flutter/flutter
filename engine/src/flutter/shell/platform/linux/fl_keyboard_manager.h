 * FlKeyboardManager:

 * A keyboard event goes through a few sections, each can choose to handle the
 * event, and only unhandled events can move to the next section:
 *
 * - Keyboard: Dispatch to the embedder responder and the channel responder
 *   simultaneously. After both responders have responded (asynchronously), the
 *   event is considered handled if either responder handles it.
 * - Text input: Events are sent to IM filter (usually owned by
 *   `TextInputManager`) and are handled synchronously.
 * - Redispatching: Events are inserted back to the system for redispatching.
