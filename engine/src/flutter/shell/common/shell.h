/// Perhaps the single most important class in the Flutter engine repository.
/// When embedders create a Flutter application, they are referring to the
/// creation of an instance of a shell. Creation and destruction of the shell is
/// synchronous and the embedder only holds a unique pointer to the shell. The
/// shell does not create the threads its primary components run on. Instead, it
/// is the embedder's responsibility to create threads and give the shell task
/// runners for those threads. Due to deterministic destruction of the shell,
/// the embedder can terminate all threads immediately after collecting the
/// shell. The shell must be created and destroyed on the same thread, but,
/// different shells (i.e. a separate instances of a Flutter application) may be
/// run on different threads simultaneously. The task runners themselves do not
/// have to be unique. If all task runner references given to the shell during
/// shell creation point to the same task runner, the Flutter application is
/// effectively single threaded.
///
/// The shell is the central nervous system of the Flutter application. None of
/// the shell components are thread safe and must be created, accessed and
/// destroyed on the same thread. To interact with one another, the various
/// components delegate to the shell for communication. Instead of using back
/// pointers to the shell, a delegation pattern is used by all components that
/// want to communicate with one another. Because of this, the shell implements
/// the delegate interface for all these components.
///
/// All shell methods accessed by the embedder may only be called on the
/// platform task runner. In case the embedder wants to directly access a shell
/// subcomponent, it is the embedder's responsibility to acquire a weak pointer
/// to that component and post a task to the task runner used by the component
/// to access its methods. The shell must also be destroyed on the platform
/// task runner.
///
/// There is no explicit API to bootstrap and shutdown the Dart VM. The first
/// instance of the shell in the process bootstraps the Dart VM and the
/// destruction of the last shell instance destroys the same. Since different
/// shells may be created and destroyed on different threads. VM bootstrap may
/// happen on one thread but its collection on another. This behavior is thread
/// safe.
