# Defines the configuration of ccache - a c/c++ compiler cache which can
# greatly reduce recompilation times.
#
# TIPS:
#
# Set clang_use_chrome_plugins=false if using ccache 3.1.9 or earlier, since
# these versions don't support -Xclang.  (3.1.10 and later will silently
# ignore -Xclang, so it doesn't matter if you disable clang_use_chrome_plugins
# or not).
#
# Use ccache 3.2 or later to avoid clang unused argument warnings:
# https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8118
#
# To avoid -Wparentheses-equality clang warnings, at some cost in terms of
# speed, you can do:
# export CCACHE_CPP2=yes

import("//build/toolchain/rbe.gni") # for use_rbe

declare_args() {
  # Set to true to enable ccache.  Probably doesn't work on windows.
  use_ccache = false
