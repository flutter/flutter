/// @brief      To do anything rendering related with Impeller, you need a
///             context.
///
///             Contexts are expensive to construct and typically you only need
///             one in the process. The context represents a connection to a
///             graphics or compute accelerator on the device.
///
///             If there are multiple context in a process, it would typically
///             be for separation of concerns (say, use with multiple engines in
///             Flutter), talking to multiple accelerators, or talking to the
///             same accelerator using different client APIs (Metal, Vulkan,
///             OpenGL ES, etc..).
///
///             Contexts are thread-safe. They may be created, used, and
///             collected (though not from a thread used by an internal pool) on
///             any thread. They may also be accessed simultaneously from
///             multiple threads.
///
///             Contexts are abstract and a concrete instance must be created
///             using one of the subclasses of `Context` in
///             `//impeller/renderer/backend`.
