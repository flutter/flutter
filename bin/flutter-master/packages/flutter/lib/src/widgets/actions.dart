/// ### Action Overriding
///
/// When using a leaf widget to build a more specialized widget, it's sometimes
/// desirable to change the default handling of an [Intent] defined in the leaf
/// widget. For instance, [TextField]'s [SelectAllTextIntent] by default selects
/// the text it currently contains, but in a US phone number widget that
/// consists of 3 different [TextField]s (area code, prefix and line number),
/// [SelectAllTextIntent] should instead select the text within all 3
/// [TextField]s.
///
/// An overridable [Action] is a special kind of [Action] created using the
/// [Action.overridable] constructor. It has access to a default [Action], and a
/// nullable override [Action]. It has the same behavior as its override if that
/// exists, and mirrors the behavior of its `defaultAction` otherwise.
///
/// The [Action.overridable] constructor creates overridable [Action]s that use
/// a [BuildContext] to find a suitable override in its ancestor [Actions]
/// widget. This can be used to provide a default implementation when creating a
/// general purpose leaf widget, and later override it when building a more
/// specialized widget using that leaf widget. Using the [TextField] example
/// above, the [TextField] widget uses an overridable [Action] to provide a
/// sensible default for [SelectAllTextIntent], while still allowing app
/// developers to change that if they add an ancestor [Actions] widget that maps
/// [SelectAllTextIntent] to a different [Action].
///
/// See the article on
/// [Using Actions and Shortcuts](https://flutter.dev/to/actions-shortcuts)
/// for a detailed explanation.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Shortcuts], which is a widget that contains a key map, in which it looks
///    up key combinations in order to invoke actions.
///  * [Actions], which is a widget that defines a map of [Intent] to [Action]
///    and allows redefining of actions for its descendants.
///  * [ActionDispatcher], a class that takes an [Action] and invokes it, passing
///    a given [Intent].
///  * [Action.overridable] for an example on how to make an [Action]

  /// When invoked, the resulting [Action] tries to find the closest [Action] in
  /// the given `context` that handles the same type of [Intent] as the
  /// `defaultAction`, then calls its [Action.invoke] method. When no override

  ///
  /// An overridable action delegates everything to its override if one exists,
  /// and has the same behavior as its `defaultAction` otherwise. For this
  /// reason, the override has full control over whether and how an [Intent]
  /// should be handled, or a key event should be consumed. An override
  /// [Action]'s [callingAction] property will be set to the [Action] it
  /// currently overrides, giving it access to the default behavior. See the
  /// [callingAction] property for an example.

  /// The `context` argument is the [BuildContext] to find the override with. It
  /// is typically a [BuildContext] above the [Actions] widget that contains
  /// this overridable [Action].

  /// The `defaultAction` argument is the [Action] to be invoked where there's
  /// no ancestor [Action]s can't be found in `context` that handle the same
