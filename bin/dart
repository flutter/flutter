# The returned filesystem path must be a format usable by Dart's URI parser,
# since the Dart command line tool treats its argument as a file URI, not a
# filename. For instance, multiple consecutive slashes should be reduced to a
# single slash, since double-slashes indicate a URI "authority", and these are
# supposed to be filenames. There is an edge case where this will return
# multiple slashes: when the input resolves to the root directory. However, if
# that were the case, we wouldn't be running this shell, so we don't do anything
# about it.
