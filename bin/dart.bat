REM Chaining the call to 'dart' and 'exit' with an ampersand ensures that
REM Windows reads both commands into memory once before executing them. This
REM avoids nasty errors that may otherwise occur when the dart command (e.g. as
REM part of 'flutter upgrade') modifies this batch script while it is executing.
REM
REM Do not use the CALL command in the next line to execute Dart. CALL causes
REM Windows to re-read the line from disk after the CALL command has finished
REM regardless of the ampersand chain.
