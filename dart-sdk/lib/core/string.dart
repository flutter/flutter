/// A sequence of UTF-16 code units.
///
/// Strings are mainly used to represent text. A character may be represented by
/// multiple code points, each code point consisting of one or two code
/// units. For example, the Papua New Guinea flag character requires four code
/// units to represent two code points, but should be treated like a single
/// character: "üáµüá¨". Platforms that do not support the flag character may show
/// the letters "PG" instead. If the code points are swapped, it instead becomes
/// the Guadeloupe flag "üá¨üáµ" ("GP").
///
/// A string can be either single or multiline. Single line strings are
/// written using matching single or double quotes, and multiline strings are
/// written using triple quotes. The following are all valid Dart strings:
/// ```dart
/// 'Single quotes';
/// "Double quotes";
/// 'Double quotes in "single" quotes';
/// "Single quotes in 'double' quotes";
///
/// '''A
/// multiline
/// string''';
///
/// """
/// Another
/// multiline
/// string""";
/// ```
/// Strings are immutable. Although you cannot change a string, you can perform
/// an operation on a string which creates a new string:
/// ```dart
/// const string = 'Dart is fun';
/// print(string.substring(0, 4)); // 'Dart'
/// ```
/// You can use the plus (`+`) operator to concatenate strings:
/// ```dart
/// const string = 'Dart ' + 'is ' + 'fun!';
/// print(string); // 'Dart is fun!'
/// ```
/// Adjacent string literals are concatenated automatically:
/// ```dart
/// const string = 'Dart ' 'is ' 'fun!';
/// print(string); // 'Dart is fun!'
/// ```
/// You can use `${}` to interpolate the value of Dart expressions
/// within strings. The curly braces can be omitted when evaluating identifiers:
/// ```dart
/// const string = 'dartlang';
/// print('$string has ${string.length} letters'); // dartlang has 8 letters
/// ```
/// A string is represented by a sequence of Unicode UTF-16 code units
/// accessible through the [codeUnitAt] or the [codeUnits] members:
/// ```dart
/// const string = 'Dart';
/// final firstCodeUnit = string.codeUnitAt(0);
/// print(firstCodeUnit); // 68, aka U+0044, the code point for 'D'.
/// final allCodeUnits = string.codeUnits;
/// print(allCodeUnits); // [68, 97, 114, 116]
/// ```
/// A string representation of the individual code units is accessible through
/// the index operator:
/// ```dart
/// const string = 'Dart';
/// final charAtIndex = string[0];
/// print(charAtIndex); // 'D'
/// ```
/// The characters of a string are encoded in UTF-16. Decoding UTF-16, which
/// combines surrogate pairs, yields Unicode code points. Following a similar
/// terminology to Go, Dart uses the name 'rune' for an integer representing a
/// Unicode code point. Use the [runes] property to get the runes of a string:
/// ```dart
/// const string = 'Dart';
/// final runes = string.runes.toList();
/// print(runes); // [68, 97, 114, 116]
/// ```
/// For a character outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (plane 0) that is
/// composed of a surrogate pair, [runes] combines the pair and returns a
/// single integer. For example, the Unicode character for a
/// musical G-clef ('ùÑû') with rune value 0x1D11E consists of a UTF-16 surrogate
/// pair: `0xD834` and `0xDD1E`. Using [codeUnits] returns the surrogate pair,
/// and using `runes` returns their combined value:
/// ```dart
/// const clef = '\u{1D11E}';
/// for (final item in clef.codeUnits) {
///   print(item.toRadixString(16));
///   // d834
///   // dd1e
/// }
/// for (final item in clef.runes) {
///   print(item.toRadixString(16)); // 1d11e
/// }
/// ```
/// The `String` class cannot be extended or implemented. Attempting to do so
/// yields a compile-time error.
///
/// ## Other resources
///
/// * [StringBuffer] to efficiently build a string incrementally.
/// * [RegExp] to work with regular expressions.
/// * [Strings and regular expressions](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/library-tour#strings-and-regular-expressions)

/// Unicode code point. Use the `runes` property to get the runes of a string.

/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// const string = 'Dart';
/// final runes = string.runes.toList();
/// print(runes); // [68, 97, 114, 116]
/// ```
///
/// For a character outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (plane 0) that is
/// composed of a surrogate pair, runes combines the pair and returns a
/// single integer.
///
/// For example, the Unicode character for "Man" emoji ('üë®', `U+1F468`) is
/// combined from the surrogates `U+d83d` and `U+dc68`.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// const emojiMan = 'üë®';

/// // Surrogate pairs:
/// for (final item in emojiMan.codeUnits) {
