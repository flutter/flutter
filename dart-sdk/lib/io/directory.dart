/// A reference to a directory (or _folder_) on the file system.
///
/// A [Directory] is an object holding a [path] on which operations can
/// be performed. The path to the directory can be [absolute] or relative.
/// It allows access to the [parent] directory,
/// since it is a [FileSystemEntity].
///
/// The [Directory] also provides static access to the system's temporary
/// file directory, [systemTemp], and the ability to access and change
/// the [current] directory.
///
/// Create a new [Directory] to give access the directory with the specified
/// path:
/// ```dart
/// var myDir = Directory('myDir');
/// ```
/// Most instance methods of [Directory] exist in both synchronous
/// and asynchronous variants, for example, [create] and [createSync].
/// Unless you have a specific reason for using the synchronous version
/// of a method, prefer the asynchronous version to avoid blocking your program.
///
/// ## Create a directory
///
/// The following code sample creates a directory using the [create] method.
/// By setting the `recursive` parameter to true, you can create the
/// named directory and all its necessary parent directories,
/// if they do not already exist.
/// ```dart
/// import 'dart:io';
///
/// void main() async {
///   // Creates dir/ and dir/subdir/.
///   var directory = await Directory('dir/subdir').create(recursive: true);
///   print(directory.path);
/// }
/// ```
/// ## List the entries of a directory
///
/// Use the [list] or [listSync] methods to get the files and directories
/// contained in a directory.
/// Set `recursive` to true to recursively list all subdirectories.
/// Set `followLinks` to true to follow symbolic links.
/// The list method returns a [Stream] of [FileSystemEntity] objects.
/// Listen on the stream to access each object as it is found:
/// ```dart
/// import 'dart:io';
///
/// void main() async {
///   // Get the system temp directory.
///   var systemTempDir = Directory.systemTemp;
///
///   // List directory contents, recursing into sub-directories,
///   // but not following symbolic links.
///   await for (var entity in
///       systemTempDir.list(recursive: true, followLinks: false)) {
///     print(entity.path);
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// ## The use of asynchronous methods
///
/// I/O operations can block a program for some period of time while it waits for
/// the operation to complete. To avoid this, all
/// methods involving I/O have an asynchronous variant which returns a [Future].
/// This future completes when the I/O operation finishes. While the I/O
/// operation is in progress, the Dart program is not blocked,
/// and can perform other operations.
///
/// For example,
/// the [exists] method, which determines whether the directory exists,
/// returns a boolean value asynchronously using a [Future].
/// ```dart
/// import 'dart:io';
///
/// void main() async {
///   final myDir = Directory('dir');
///   var isThere = await myDir.exists();
///   print(isThere ? 'exists' : 'nonexistent');
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In addition to [exists], the [stat], [rename],
/// and other methods are also asynchronous.
///

///   section of the library tour.
