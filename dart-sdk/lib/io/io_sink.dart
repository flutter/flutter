/// An [IOSink] combines a [StreamSink] of bytes with a [StringSink],
/// and allows easy output of both bytes and text.
///
/// An `IOSink` is intended for writing bytes.
/// Strings written through [write] or [writeCharCode] will be converted
/// to bytes using [encoding].
/// Integer data added using [add] or [addStream] will be treated as byte data,
/// and will be truncated to unsigned 8-bit values as by using [int.toUnsigned].
/// No guarantees are given for when such a conversion happens, since it
/// depends on the implementation behind the sink.
///
/// Writing text ([write]) and adding bytes ([add]) may be interleaved freely.
///
/// While a stream is being added using [addStream], any further attempts
/// to add or write to the [IOSink] will fail until the [addStream] completes.
///
/// It is an error to add data to the [IOSink] after the sink is closed.
