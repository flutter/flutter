# describes breaking changes in the SDK as a whole, separately from the
# individual packages in the SDK. For example, if the flutter command line
# tool's options change in an incompatible way, this version will update to
# reflect that change. However, if the API for package:flutter changes in an
# incompatible way, this version number might not change. Instead, the version
# number for package:flutter will update to reflect that change.
