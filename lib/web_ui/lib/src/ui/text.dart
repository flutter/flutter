/// A direction in which text flows.
///
/// Some languages are written from the left to the right (for example, English,

/// example Aramaic, Hebrew, or Urdu). Some are also written in a mixture, for
/// example Arabic is mostly written right-to-left, with numerals written
/// left-to-right.
///
/// The text direction must be provided to APIs that render text or lay out
/// boxes horizontally, so that they can determine which direction to start in:
/// either right-to-left, [TextDirection.rtl]; or left-to-right,
/// [TextDirection.ltr].
///
/// ## Design discussion
///
/// Flutter is designed to address the needs of applications written in any of
/// the world's currently-used languages, whether they use a right-to-left or
/// left-to-right writing direction. Flutter does not support other writing
/// modes, such as vertical text or boustrophedon text, as these are rarely used
/// in computer programs.
///
/// It is common when developing user interface frameworks to pick a default
/// text direction — typically left-to-right, the direction most familiar to the
/// engineers working on the framework — because this simplifies the development
/// of applications on the platform. Unfortunately, this frequently results in
/// the platform having unexpected left-to-right biases or assumptions, as
/// engineers will typically miss places where they need to support
/// right-to-left text. This then results in bugs that only manifest in
/// right-to-left environments.
///
/// In an effort to minimize the extent to which Flutter experiences this
/// category of issues, the lowest levels of the Flutter framework do not have a
/// default text reading direction. Any time a reading direction is necessary,
/// for example when text is to be displayed, or when a
/// writing-direction-dependent value is to be interpreted, the reading
/// direction must be explicitly specified. Where possible, such as in `switch`
/// statements, the right-to-left case is listed first, to avoid the impression
/// that it is an afterthought.
///
/// At the higher levels (specifically starting at the widgets library), an
/// ambient [Directionality] is introduced, which provides a default. Thus, for
/// instance, a [Text] widget in the scope of a [MaterialApp] widget does not
/// need to be given an explicit writing direction. The [Directionality.of]
/// static method can be used to obtain the ambient text direction for a
/// particular [BuildContext].
///
/// ### Known left-to-right biases in Flutter
///
/// Despite the design intent described above, certain left-to-right biases have
/// nonetheless crept into Flutter's design. These include:
///
///  * The [Canvas] origin is at the top left, and the x-axis increases in a
///    left-to-right direction.
///
///  * The default localization in the widgets and material libraries is
///    American English, which is left-to-right.
///
/// ### Visual properties vs directional properties
///
/// Many classes in the Flutter framework are offered in two versions, a
/// visually-oriented variant, and a text-direction-dependent variant. For
/// example, [EdgeInsets] is described in terms of top, left, right, and bottom,
/// while [EdgeInsetsDirectional] is described in terms of top, start, end, and
/// bottom, where start and end correspond to right and left in right-to-left
/// text and left and right in left-to-right text.
///
/// There are distinct use cases for each of these variants.
///
/// Text-direction-dependent variants are useful when developing user interfaces
/// that should "flip" with the text direction. For example, a paragraph of text
/// in English will typically be left-aligned and a quote will be indented from
/// the left, while in Arabic it will be right-aligned and indented from the
/// right. Both of these cases are described by the direction-dependent
/// [TextAlign.start] and [EdgeInsetsDirectional.start].
///
/// In contrast, the visual variants are useful when the text direction is known
/// and not affected by the reading direction. For example, an application
/// giving driving directions might show a "turn left" arrow on the left and a
/// "turn right" arrow on the right — and would do so whether the application
/// was localized to French (left-to-right) or Hebrew (right-to-left).
///
/// In practice, it is also expected that many developers will only be
/// targeting one language, and in that case it may be simpler to think in
/// visual terms.
// The order of this enum must match the order of the values in TextDirection.h's TextDirection.
enum TextDirection {
  /// The text flows from right to left (e.g. Arabic, Hebrew).
  rtl,

  /// The text flows from left to right (e.g., English, French).
  ltr,
}

/// A rectangle enclosing a run of text.
///
