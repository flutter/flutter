#
# There are three similar analysis options files in the flutter repo:
#   - .analysis_options
#   - .analysis_options_repo (this file)
#   - packages/flutter/lib/analysis_options_user.yaml
#
# This file contains the analysis options used by 'flutter analyze' when analyzing
# the flutter repository. It is very similar to .analysis_options;
# the only difference (currently) is the public_member_api_docs option,
# which is turned on and programmatically reduced to a single output line
# indicating the # of violations for that rule.
