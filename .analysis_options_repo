# This file contains the analysis options used by 'flutter analyze' when analyzing
# the flutter repository. It is very similar to .analysis_options;
# the only difference (currently) is the public_member_api_docs option,
# which is turned on and programmatically reduced to a single output line
# indicating the # of violations for that rule.
