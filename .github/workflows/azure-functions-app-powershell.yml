# This workflow will deploy a PowerShell project to an Azure Functions App on Windows or Linux when a commit is pushed to your default branch.
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target Azure Functions app.
# For instructions see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-powershell
#
# To configure this workflow:
# 1. Set up the following secrets in your repository:
#   - AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE
# 2. Change env variables for your configuration.
