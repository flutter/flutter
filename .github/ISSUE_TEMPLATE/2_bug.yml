      description: |
        Please create a minimal reproducible sample that shows the problem
        and attach it below between the lines with the backticks.

        To create it, use the `flutter create bug` command and update the `main.dart` file.

        Alternatively, you can use https://dartpad.dev/ or create a public GitHub
        repository to share your sample.

        Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that
        we regretfully will have to close it.

        Note: Please do not upload screenshots of text. Instead, use code blocks
        or the above mentioned ways to upload your code sample.

        Include the full logs of the commands you are running between the lines

        please include the output of running them with `--verbose`; for example,
        the output of running `flutter --verbose create foo`.

        If the logs are too large to be uploaded to GitHub, you may upload
        them as a `txt` file or use online tools like https://pastebin.com to
        share it.
