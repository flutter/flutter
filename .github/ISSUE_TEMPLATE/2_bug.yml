        Please create a minimal reproducible sample that shows the problem
        and attach it below between the lines with the backticks.

        To create it you can use `flutter create bug` command and update the `main.dart` file.

        Alternatively, you can use https://dartpad.dev/
        which is capable of creating and running small Flutter apps.

        If your sample includes changes to native code, ideally you can create
        a public Github repository and paste the link to it here

        Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that
        we regretfully will have to close it.

        Note: Please do not upload screenshots of text. Instead, use code blocks
        or the above mentioned ways to upload your code sample.

        Include the full logs of the commands you are running between the lines

        please include the output of running them with `--verbose`; for example,
        the output of running `flutter --verbose create foo`.

        If the logs are too large to be uploaded to Github, you may upload
        them as a `txt` file or use online tools like https://pastebin.com to
        share it.
