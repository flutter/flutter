        You can remove private dependencies from the file if they are sensitive.

        you may use online tools like https://pastebin.com and share the url here.

        or the above mentioned ways to upload this.

      description: |
        Please create a minimal reproducible sample that shows the problem
        and attach it below between the lines with the backticks.

        To create it, use the `flutter create bug` command and update the `main.dart` file.

        Alternatively, you can create a public GitHub repository to share your sample.

        Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that
        we regretfully will have to close it.

        You can also refer to the package's example project if it is simple enough
        to reproduce the bug.

        Note: Please do not upload screenshots of text. Instead, use code blocks
        or the above mentioned ways to upload your code sample.

        the output of running `flutter --verbose create foo`.

        If the logs are too large to be uploaded to GitHub, you may upload
        them as a `txt` file or use online tools like https://pastebin.com to
