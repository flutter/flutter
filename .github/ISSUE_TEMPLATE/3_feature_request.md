<!-- Thank you for using Flutter!

     If you are looking for support, please check out our documentation
     or consider asking a question on Stack Overflow:
      * https://flutter.dev/
      * https://api.flutter.dev/
      * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flutter?sort=frequent

     If you have found a bug or if our documentation doesn't have an answer
     to what you're looking for, then fill out the template below. Please read
     our guide to filing a bug first: https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/bug-reports

## Use case

<!--
     Please tell us the problem you are running into that led to you wanting
     a new feature.

     Is your feature request related to a problem? Please give a clear and
     concise description of what the problem is.

     Describe the alternative solutions you've considered. Is there a package
     on pub.dev/flutter that already solves this?
-->

## Proposal

<!--
     Briefly but precisely describe what you would like Flutter to be able to do.

     Consider attaching something showing what you are imagining:
      * images
      * videos
      * code samples

     Does this have to be provided by Flutter directly, or can it be provided
     by a package on pub.dev/flutter? If so, maybe consider implementing and
     publishing such a package rather than filing a bug.
