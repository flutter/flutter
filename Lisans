the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey
the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to
the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined
will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

\item Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

\item Disclaimer of Warranty.

\begin{sloppypar}
 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
 COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS''
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE
 RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
 SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
 NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\end{sloppypar}

\item Limitation of Liability.

 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
 AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
 DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
 DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
 (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
 INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
 OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
 HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.

\item Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
\end{center}

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

Copyright (C) <textyear>  <name of author>

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
\end{verbatim}
}

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a ``Source'' link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU AGPL, see \texttt{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/}.
