# Specify analysis options.

# Until there are meta linter rules, each desired lint must be explicitly enabled.

#
# There are three similar analysis options files in the flutter repo:
#   - .analysis_options (this file)
#   - .analysis_options_repo
#   - packages/flutter/lib/analysis_options_user.yaml
#
# This file contains the analysis options used by Flutter editors, such as Atom.
# It is very similar to the .analysis_options_repo file in this same directory;
# the only difference (currently) is the public_member_api_docs option,
# which triggers too many messages to be used in editors.
