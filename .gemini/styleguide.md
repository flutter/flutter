## Best Practices

- Code should follow the guidance and principles described in
  [the Flutter contribution guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Code should be tested and follow the guidance described in the [writing effective tests guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/contributing/testing/Writing-Effective-Tests.md) and the [running and writing tests guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/contributing/testing/Running-and-writing-tests.md). 
- Changes to the [engine/ directory](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/engine) should additionally have appropriate tests as described in [the engine test guidance](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/engine/src/flutter/docs/testing/Testing-the-engine.md).
- PR descriptions should include the Pre-launch Checklist from
  [the PR template](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md),
