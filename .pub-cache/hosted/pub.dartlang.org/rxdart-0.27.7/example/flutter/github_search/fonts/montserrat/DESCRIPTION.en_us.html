<p>The old posters and signs in the traditional neighborhood of Buenos Aires
called Montserrat inspired me to design a typeface that rescues the beauty of
urban typography from the first half of the twentieth century. The goal is to
rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free, under a free, libre and open
source license, the SIL Open Font License.</p>

<p>As urban development changes this place, it will never return to its
original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. To
draw the letters, I rely on examples of lettering in the urban space. Each
selected example produces its own variants in length, width and height
proportions, each adding to the Montserrat family. The old typographies and
canopies are irretrievable when they are replaced.</p>

<p>There are other revivals, but those do not stay close to the originals. The
letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color,
contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that make the
city look so beautiful.</p>

<p>This is the Regular family, and it has two sister families so far,
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates">Alternates</a> and
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat+Subrayada">Subrayada</a>
families. Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family,
