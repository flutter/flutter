/// Runs all of the BuilderApplications in [builders] once.
///
/// By default, the user will be prompted to delete any files which already
/// exist but were not generated by this specific build script. The
/// [deleteFilesByDefault] option can be set to `true` to skip this prompt.
///
/// A [packageGraph] may be supplied, otherwise one will be constructed using
/// [PackageGraph.forThisPackage]. The default functionality assumes you are
/// running in the root directory of a package, with both a `pubspec.yaml` and
/// `.packages` file present.
///
/// A [reader] and [writer] may also be supplied, which can read/write assets
/// to arbitrary locations or file systems. By default they will write directly
/// to the root package directory, and will use the [packageGraph] to know where
/// to read files from.
///
/// Logging may be customized by passing a custom [logLevel] below which logs
/// will be ignored, as well as an [onLog] handler which defaults to [print].
///
/// The [terminateEventStream] is a stream which can send termination events.
/// By default the [ProcessSignal.sigint] stream is used. In this mode, it
/// will simply consume the first event and allow the build to continue.
/// Multiple termination events will cause a normal shutdown.
///
/// If [outputSymlinksOnly] is `true`, then the merged output directories will
/// contain only symlinks, which is much faster but not generally suitable for
/// deployment.
///
/// If [verbose] is `true` then verbose logging will be enabled. This changes
/// the default [logLevel] to [Level.ALL] and removes stack frame folding, among
/// other things.
