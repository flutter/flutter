# How to contribute

### Sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Even for small changes, we ask that you please sign the CLA electronically
[here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).
The CLA is necessary because you own the copyright to your changes, even
after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission
to use and distribute your code. You can find more details
[here](https://code.google.com/p/dart/wiki/Contributing).
