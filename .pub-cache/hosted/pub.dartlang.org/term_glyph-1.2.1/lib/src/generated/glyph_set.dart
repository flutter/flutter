///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:term_glyph/term_glyph.dart' as glyph;
///
/// /// Adds a vertical line to the left of [text].
/// ///
/// /// If [unicode] is `true`, this uses Unicode for the line. If it's
/// /// `false`, this uses plain ASCII characters. If it's `null`, it
/// /// defaults to [glyph.ascii].
/// void addVerticalLine(String text, {bool unicode}) {
///   var glyphs =
///       (unicode ?? !glyph.ascii) ? glyph.unicodeGlyphs : glyph.asciiGlyphs;
///
///   return text
///       .split('\n')
///       .map((line) => '${glyphs.verticalLine} $line')
