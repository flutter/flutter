## Usage

### Import the package


This package has been endorsed, meaning that you only need to add `connectivity`
as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`. It will be automatically included in your app
when you depend on `package:connectivity`.

This is what the above means to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  connectivity: ^0.4.8
  ...
```

Refer to the `connectivity` [documentation](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/connectivity/connectivity) for more details.
