  # The implementation of this plugin doesn't explicitly depend on the method channel
  # defined in the platform interface.
  # To prevent potential breakages, this dependency is added.
  #
  # In the future, this plugin's platform code should be able to reference the
  # interface's platform code. (Android already supports this).
