# How `flutter` fetches engine artifacts

[flutter.dev/to/engine-artifacts](https://flutter.dev/to/engine-artifacts)

While in the same repository, the `flutter` (tool), which is used to run and
test the framework, needs to know how to download the engine artifacts for the
current platform and target device. Engine artifacts include `dart` (the
standalone Dart SDK), which runs `flutter` itself, and per-platform and build
mode prebuilt engines (which include the C++ compiled engine, and the embedders
for Android, iOS, and so-on).

![An example of cached engine artifacts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47c45971-5c5c-4a01-8239-8af0b98cabb8)

When using a _released_ version of Flutter, i.e. from a channel such as `stable`,
[`bin/internal/engine.version`](../../bin/internal/engine.version) is set to the
git commit SHA for a merged commit in `https://github.com/flutter/flutter`, where
the engine artifacts have already been pre-built and uploaded.

When using the `master` channel, or _contributing_ to Flutter (which is typically
as a fork of Flutter's `master` channel), the git commit SHA is _computed_ by
using `git merge-base HEAD upstream/master` (falling back to `git merge-base HEAD origin/master`
to support direct forks or `flutter/flutter`).

For _advanced_ use-cases, such as on CI platforms, or for custom 1-off testing
using a pre-built Flutter engine (to use a _locally_ built Flutter engine see
[locally built engines](../contributing/testing/Running-and-writing-tests.md#locally-built-engines)), the environment variable `FLUTTER_PREBUILT_ENGINE_VERSION` can be set,
again to a git commit SHA for a merged commit in `flutter/flutter`:

```sh
$ FLUTTER_PREBUILT_ENGINE_VERSION=abc123 flutter --version
..
Engine â€¢ revision abc123 ..
..
```

## Flutter CI/CD Testing

On Cocoon (Flutter's internal CI/CD) we _often_ set
`FLUTTER_PREBUILT_ENGINE_VERSION` to the following:

| Branch                    | Presubmit    | Merge Queue        | Postsubmit                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `main`                    | `commit.sha` | _Uses normal flow_ | _Uses normal flow_                |
| `flutter-x.x-candidate.x` | `commit.sha` | N/A[^1]            | `commit.sha`                      |
| `stable` or `beta`        | N/A[^3]      | N/A[^1]            | N/A[^3]                           |
| _anything else_[^2]       | `commit.sha` | _Uses normal flow_ | _Uses postsubmit engine artifacts_ |

> IMPORTANT: `engine.version` is intentionally ignored in release candidate
> post-submit builds.
>
> To generate a new `engine.version`:
>
> ```sh
> ./bin/internal/last_engine_commit.sh > ./bin/internal/engine.version
> ```

> release with an out of date `engine.version`.
