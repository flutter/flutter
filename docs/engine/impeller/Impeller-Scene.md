Impeller Scene was an experimental 3D C++ renderer built into Flutter Engine and [presented at the Flutter Forward event](https://www.youtube.com/live/zKQYGKAe5W8?feature=share&t=7048).

It has since been rewritten as a Dart library called [Flutter Scene](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_scene), powered by the [Flutter GPU](Flutter-GPU.md) API.
