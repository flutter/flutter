When triaging web issues follow the following process:

* Make sure there are no [unassigned P0 and P1 issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ateam-web+label%3AP1%2CP0+no%3Aassignee).
* Make sure there are no [P1 issues outside the backlog](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ateam-web+label%3AP1%2CP0+-project%3Aflutter%2F41+).
* Make sure there are no [P3 issues in the backlog](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Aflutter%2F41+label%3AP3).
* Make sure there are no assigned P2 and P3 issues (if you'd like to become a regular Flutter Web contributor, please ping yjbanov on Discord to be added to this list, and we'll watch that your issues are properly triaged):

* All [P0 issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ateam-web+label%3AP0) are assigned and being worked on.
* The list of [P1 issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ateam-web+label%3AP1) should be manageable (<30 issues)
* The [list of open PRs](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+archived%3Afalse+user%3Aflutter+sort%3Aupdated-asc+label%3Aplatform-web) should be manageable (<15).
* Triage [untriaged issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ateam-web%2Cfyi-web+-label%3Atriaged-web+no%3Aassignee+-label%3A%22will+need+additional+triage%22+sort%3Aupdated-asc+-label%3A%22waiting+for+customer+response%22+)
