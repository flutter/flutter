# Specify analysis options.
#
# Until there are meta linter rules, each desired lint must be explicitly enabled.
# See: https://github.com/dart-lang/linter/issues/288

# For a list of lints, see: http://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/

#
# There are four similar analysis options files in the flutter repos:
#   - analysis_options.yaml (this file)
#   - analysis_options_repo.yaml
#   - packages/flutter/lib/analysis_options_user.yaml
#   - https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml
#
# This file contains the analysis options used by Flutter tools, such as IntelliJ,
# Android Studio, and the `flutter analyze` command.
# It is very similar to the analysis_options_repo.yaml file in this same directory;
# the only difference (currently) is the public_member_api_docs option,
# which triggers too many messages to be used in editors.
#
# The flutter/plugins repo contains a copy of this file, which should be kept
# in sync with this file.
