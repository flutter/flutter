# ðŸš€ Feature Request

## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The current navigation bar on the Flutter website is not fully optimized for mobile devices. It lacks proper responsiveness and a collapsible menu.

## Describe the solution you'd like
Implement a fully responsive navigation bar using Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or custom CSS. The navbar should:
- Collapse into a mobile-friendly menu.
- Maintain a clean UI across different screen sizes.
- Ensure accessibility and performance.

## Describe alternatives you've considered
- Using a standard dropdown menu.
- Keeping the navbar static without changes.

## Additional context
A well-designed responsive navbar improves user experience and navigation on smaller screens.
