// functor and then call for_each() on the range and functor, but this
// requires us to pull in all of algorithm.h, which seems expensive.
// For hash_[multi]set, it is important that this deletes behind the iterator
// because the hash_set may call the hash function on the iterator when it is
// advanced, which could result in the hash function trying to deference a
