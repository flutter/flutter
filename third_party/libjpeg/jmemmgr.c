 * This file contains the JPEG system-independent memory management
 * routines.  This code is usable across a wide variety of machines; most
 * of the system dependencies have been isolated in a separate file.
 * The major functions provided here are:
 *   * pool-based allocation and freeing of memory;
 *   * policy decisions about how to divide available memory among the
 *     virtual arrays;
 *   * control logic for swapping virtual arrays between main memory and
 *     backing storage.
 * The separate system-dependent file provides the actual backing-storage
 * access code, and it contains the policy decision about how much total
 * main memory to use.
 * This file is system-dependent in the sense that some of its functions
 * are unnecessary in some systems.  For example, if there is enough virtual
 * memory so that backing storage will never be used, much of the virtual
 * array control logic could be removed.  (Of course, if you have that much
 * memory then you shouldn't care about a little bit of unused code...)

 * Some important notes:
 *   The allocation routines provided here must never return NULL.
 *   They should exit to error_exit if unsuccessful.
 *
 *   It's not a good idea to try to merge the sarray and barray routines,
 *   even though they are textually almost the same, because samples are
 *   usually stored as bytes while coefficients are shorts or ints.  Thus,
 *   in machines where byte pointers have a different representation from
 *   word pointers, the resulting machine code could not be the same.

/*
 * Many machines require storage alignment: longs must start on 4-byte
 * boundaries, doubles on 8-byte boundaries, etc.  On such machines, malloc()
 * always returns pointers that are multiples of the worst-case alignment
 * requirement, and we had better do so too.
 * There isn't any really portable way to determine the worst-case alignment
 * requirement.  This module assumes that the alignment requirement is
 * multiples of sizeof(ALIGN_TYPE).
 * By default, we define ALIGN_TYPE as double.  This is necessary on some
 * workstations (where doubles really do need 8-byte alignment) and will work
 * fine on nearly everything.  If your machine has lesser alignment needs,
 * you can save a few bytes by making ALIGN_TYPE smaller.
 * The only place I know of where this will NOT work is certain Macintosh
 * 680x0 compilers that define double as a 10-byte IEEE extended float.
 * Doing 10-byte alignment is counterproductive because longwords won't be
 * aligned well.  Put "#define ALIGN_TYPE long" in jconfig.h if you have
 * such a compiler.

 * We allocate objects from "pools", where each pool is gotten with a single

 * overhead within a pool, except for alignment padding.  Each pool has a
 * header with a link to the next pool of the same class.
 * Small and large pool headers are identical except that the latter's
 * link pointer must be FAR on 80x86 machines.
 * Notice that the "real" header fields are union'ed with a dummy ALIGN_TYPE
 * field.  This forces the compiler to make SIZEOF(small_pool_hdr) a multiple

/*
 * About virtual array management:
 *
 * The above "normal" array routines are only used to allocate strip buffers
 * (as wide as the image, but just a few rows high).  Full-image-sized buffers
 * are handled as "virtual" arrays.  The array is still accessed a strip at a
 * time, but the memory manager must save the whole array for repeated
 * accesses.  The intended implementation is that there is a strip buffer in
 * memory (as high as is possible given the desired memory limit), plus a
 * backing file that holds the rest of the array.
 *
 * The request_virt_array routines are told the total size of the image and
 * the maximum number of rows that will be accessed at once.  The in-memory
 * buffer must be at least as large as the maxaccess value.
 *
 * The request routines create control blocks but not the in-memory buffers.
 * That is postponed until realize_virt_arrays is called.  At that time the
 * total amount of space needed is known (approximately, anyway), so free
 * memory can be divided up fairly.
 *
 * The access_virt_array routines are responsible for making a specific strip
 * area accessible (after reading or writing the backing file, if necessary).
 * Note that the access routines are told whether the caller intends to modify
 * the accessed strip; during a read-only pass this saves having to rewrite
 * data to disk.  The access routines are also responsible for pre-zeroing
 * any newly accessed rows, if pre-zeroing was requested.
 *
 * In current usage, the access requests are usually for nonoverlapping
 * strips; that is, successive access start_row numbers differ by exactly
 * num_rows = maxaccess.  This means we can get good performance with simple
 * buffer dump/reload logic, by making the in-memory buffer be a multiple
 * of the access height; then there will never be accesses across bufferload
 * boundaries.  The code will still work with overlapping access requests,
 * but it doesn't handle bufferload overlaps very efficiently.
