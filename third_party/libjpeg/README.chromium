Description:
This contains a copy of libjpeg-6b.

The project files does not incldue from the distribution:
  jidctred.c : downsampling
  jdtrans.c : decoder transcoder

Also not included are files obviously not needed:
  jmemdos.c
  jmemname.c
along with all of the frontend files for doing utility programs.

We added a new file jpeglibmangler.h and included it from jpeglib.h that changes
the names of all externally visible functions to chromium_ijg_* so that we can
avoid conflicts that arise when system libraries attempt to use our libjpeg.

Also patch in google.jdmarker.patch to better handle multiple SOS CSi values and
their ordering.
