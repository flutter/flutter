# The yasm build process creates a slew of small C subprograms that
# dynamically generate files at various point in the build process.  This makes
# the build integration moderately complex.
#
# There are three classes of dynamically generated files:
#   1) C source files that should be included in the build (eg., lc3bid.c)
#   2) C source files that are #included by static C sources (eg., license.c)
#   3) Intermediate files that are used as input by other subprograms to
#      further generate files in category #1 or #2.  (eg., version.mac)
#
# This structure is represented with the following targets:
#   1) yasm -- Sources, flags for the main yasm executable. Also has most of
#              of the actions and rules that invoke the subprograms.
#   2) yasm_config -- General build configuration including setting a
#              inputs listing the checked in version of files
#              generated by manually running configure. These manually
#              generated files are used by all binaries.
#   3) yasm_utils -- Object files with memory management and hashing utilities
#              shared between yasm and the genperf subprogram.
#   4) genmacro, genmodule, etc. -- One executable target for each subprogram.
#   5) generate_license, generate_module, etc. -- Actions that invoke programs
#              built in #4 to generate .c files.
#   6) compile_gperf, compile_re2c, etc. -- Actions that invoke programs that
#              turn intermediate files into .c files.
