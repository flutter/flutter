Description:
Android Platform engineering tools, specifically stack symbolization scripts
and a jar containing the AOSP framework to compile the Android WebView
glue layer against. The sources used to build the AOSP framework jar can be
checked out using repo on the corresponding manifest file.

Local Modifications:
Only picked the few scripts needed by chrome.
Updated output directories to use environment variable.
When calling addr2line, check the symbol is a file (and not a directory).
Added support for parsing LOG(FATAL) and DCHECK errors and their
    stack traces, as emitted by src/base/debug/stack_trace_android.cc
Added support for finding symbols when library is loaded directly from the APK.
Changed the toolchain to remove references to 4.6 toolchains.
