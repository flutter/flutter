Local Modifications:
Rather than use libevent's own build system, we just build a Chrome
static library using GYP.

1) Run configure and "make event-config.h" on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris,
   and Mac and copy config.h and event-config.h to linux/, freebsd/,
   solaris/, and mac/ respectively.
2) Add libevent.gyp.
3) chromium.patch is applied to allow libevent to be used without
   being installed and to fix a race condition.
4) The directories WIN32-Code and WIN32-Prj are not included.
5) Apply r87338.
6) The configs for android were copied from Linux's which were very close to
   android one with the exception of HAVE_FD_MASK and HAVE_STRLCPY.
7) Add files to support building with the PNaCl toolchain. Added
   libevent_nacl_nonsfi.gyp for build rule. nacl_nonsfi/config.h and
   nacl_nonsfi/event-config.h are derived from linux/ counterparts.
   nacl_nonsfi/random.c is also added to provide the random() function,
   which is missing in the newlib-based PNaCl toolchain.
8) Apply https://github.com/libevent/libevent/commit/ea6b1df
9) Stub out signal.c for nacl_helper_nonsfi. socketpair() will be prohibited
   by sandbox in nacl_helper_nonsfi.
