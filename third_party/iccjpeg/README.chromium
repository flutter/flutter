Original author is Tom Lane, from the IJG group.
We include the relevant part of the original IJG licensing term

Local Modifications:
* On BSD platforms we might need to include to correct header file from
  the system, so a USE_SYSTEM_LIBJPEG ifdef is added to iccjpeg.h in order
  to be able to decide which jpeglib.h header to include.
