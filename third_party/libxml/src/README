To build on an Unixised setup:
   ./configure ; make ; make install
To build on Windows:
   see instructions on win32/Readme.txt

To assert build quality:
   on an Unixised setup:
      run make tests
   otherwise:
       There is 3 standalone tools runtest.c runsuite.c testapi.c, which
       should compile as part of the build or as any application would.
       Launch them from this directory to get results, runtest checks 
       the proper functionning of libxml2 main APIs while testapi does
       a full coverage check. Report failures to the list.
