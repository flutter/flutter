Overview of changes leading to 0.9.36
Thursday, November 20, 2014
=====================================

- First time that three months went by without a release since
  0.9.2 was released on August 10, 2012!
- Fix performance bug in hb_ot_collect_glyphs():
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1090869
- Add basic vertical-text support to hb-ot-font.
- Misc build fixes.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.35
Saturday, August 13, 2014
=====================================

- Fix major shape-plan caching bug when more than one shaper were
  provided to hb_shape_full() (as exercised by XeTeX).
  http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-bugs-dist@lists.debian.org/msg1246370.html
- Fix Arabic fallback shaping regression.  This was broken in 0.9.32.
- Major hb-coretext fixes.  That backend is complete now, including
  respecing buffer direction and language, down to vertical writing.
- Build fixes for Windows CE.  Should build fine now.
- Misc fixes:
  Use atexit() only if it's safe to call from shared library
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82246
  Mandaic had errors in its Unicode Joining_Type
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82306
- API changes:

  * hb_buffer_clear_contents() does not reset buffer flags now.

    After 763e5466c0a03a7c27020e1e2598e488612529a7, one doesn't
    need to set flags for different pieces of text.  The flags now
    are something the client sets up once, depending on how it
    actually uses the buffer.  As such, don't clear it in
    clear_contents().

    I don't expect any changes to be needed to any existing client.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.34
Saturday, August 2, 2014
=====================================

- hb_feature_from_string() now accepts CSS font-feature-settings format.
- As a result, hb-shape / hb-view --features also accept CSS-style strings.
  Eg, "'liga' off" is accepted now.
- Add old-spec Myanmar shaper:
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=81775
- Don't apply 'calt' in Hangul shaper.
- Fix mark advance zeroing for Hebrew shaper:
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76767
- Implement Windows-1256 custom Arabic shaping.  Only built on Windows,
  and requires help from get_glyph().  Used by Firefox.
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1045139
- Disable 'liga' in vertical text.
- Build fixes.
- API changes:

  * Make HB_BUFFER_FLAG_BOT/EOT easier to use.

    Previously, we expected users to provide BOT/EOT flags when the
    text *segment* was at paragraph boundaries.  This meant that for
    clients that provide full paragraph to HarfBuzz (eg. Pango), they
    had code like this:

      hb_buffer_set_flags (hb_buffer,
                           (item_offset == 0 ? HB_BUFFER_FLAG_BOT : 0) |
                           (item_offset + item_length == paragraph_length ?
                            HB_BUFFER_FLAG_EOT : 0));

      hb_buffer_add_utf8 (hb_buffer,
                          paragraph_text, paragraph_length,
                          item_offset, item_length);

    After this change such clients can simply say:

      hb_buffer_set_flags (hb_buffer,
                           HB_BUFFER_FLAG_BOT | HB_BUFFER_FLAG_EOT);

      hb_buffer_add_utf8 (hb_buffer,
                          paragraph_text, paragraph_length,
                          item_offset, item_length);

    Ie, HarfBuzz itself checks whether the segment is at the beginning/end
    of the paragraph.  Clients that only pass item-at-a-time to HarfBuzz
    continue not setting any flags whatsoever.

    Another way to put it is: if there's pre-context text in the buffer,
    HarfBuzz ignores the BOT flag.  If there's post-context, it ignores
    EOT flag.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.33
Tuesday, July 22, 2014
=====================================

- Turn off ARabic 'cswh' feature that was accidentally turned on.
- Add HB_TAG_MAX_SIGNED.
- Make hb_face_make_immutable() really make face immutable!
- Windows build fixes.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.32
Thursday, July 17, 2014
=====================================

- Another fix for Mongolian free variation selectors.
- For non-Arabic scripts in Arabic shaper apply 'rlig' and 'calt'
  together.
- Minor adjustment to U+FFFD logic.

Overview of changes leading to 0.9.31
Wednesday, July 16, 2014
=====================================

- Only accept valid UTF-8/16/32; we missed many cases before.
- Better shaping of invalid UTF-8/16/32.  Falls back to
  U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER now.
- With all changes in this release, the buffer will contain fully
  valid Unicode after hb_buffer_add_utf8/16/32 no matter how
  broken the input is.  This can be overriden though.  See below.
- Fix Mongolian Variation Selectors for fonts without GDEF.
- Fix minor invalid buffer access.
- Accept zh-Hant and zh-Hans language tags.  hb_ot_tag_to_language()
  now uses these instead of private tags.
- Build fixes.
- New API:
  * hb_buffer_add_codepoints().  This does what hb_buffer_add_utf32()
    used to do, ie. no validity check on the input at all.  add_utf32
    now replaces invalid Unicode codepoints with the replacement
    character (see below).
  * hb_buffer_set_replacement_codepoint()
  * hb_buffer_get_replacement_codepoint()
    Previously, in hb_buffer_add_utf8 and hb_buffer_add_utf16, when
    we detected broken input, we replaced that with (hb_codepoint_t)-1.
    This has changed to use U+FFFD now, but can be changed using these
    new API.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.30
Wednesday, July 9, 2014
=====================================

- Fix undefined memory access.
- Add Javanese config to Indic shaper.
- Misc bug fixes.

Overview of changes leading to 0.9.18
Tuesday, May 28, 2013
=====================================

New build system:

- All unneeded code is all disabled by default,

- Uniscribe and CoreText shapers can be enabled with their --with options,

- icu_le and old shapers cannot be enabled for now,

- glib, freetype, and cairo will be detected automatically.
  They can be force on/off'ed with their --with options,

- icu and graphite2 are default off, can be enabled with their --with
  options,

Moreover, ICU support is now build into a separate library:
libharfbuzz-icu.so, and a new harfbuzz-icu.pc is shipped for it.
Distros can enable ICU now without every application on earth
getting linked to via libharfbuzz.so.

For distros I recommend that they make sure they are building --with-glib
--with-freetype --with-cairo, --with-icu, and optionally --with-graphite2;
And package harfbuzz and harfbuzz-icu separately.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.17
Monday, May 20, 2013
=====================================

- Build fixes.
- Fix bug in hb_set_get_min().
- Fix regression with Arabic mark positioning / width-zeroing.

Overview of changes leading to 0.9.16
Friday, April 19, 2013
=====================================

- Major speedup in OpenType lookup processing.  With the Amiri
  Arabic font, this release is over 3x faster than previous
  release.  All scripts / languages should see this speedup.

- New --num-iterations option for hb-shape / hb-view; useful for
  profiling.

Overview of changes leading to 0.9.15

Overview of changes leading to 0.9.13
Thursday, February 25, 2013
=====================================

- Build fixes.
- Ngapi HarfBuzz Hackfest in London (February 2013):
  * Fixed all known Indic bugs,
  * New Win8-style Myanmar shaper,
  * New South-East Asian shaper for Tai Tham, Cham, and New Tai Lue,
  * Smartly ignore Default_Ignorable characters (joiners, etc) wheb
    matching GSUB/GPOS lookups,
  * Fix 'Phags-Pa U+A872 shaping,
  * Fix partial disabling of default-on features,
  * Allow disabling of TrueType kerning.
- Fix possible crasher with broken fonts with overlapping tables.
- Removed generated files from git again.  So, one needs ragel to
  bootstrap from the git tree.

API changes:
- hb_shape() and related APIs now abort if buffer direction is
  HB_DIRECTION_INVALID.  Previously, hb_shape() was calling
  hb_buffer_guess_segment_properties() on the buffer before
  shaping.  The heuristics in that function are fragile.  If the
  user really wants the old behvaior, they can call that function
  right before calling hb_shape() to get the old behavior.
- hb_blob_create_sub_blob() always creates sub-blob with
  HB_MEMORY_MODE_READONLY.  See comments for the reason.

    subclass automatically chainup to the parent.  When chaining up,
    scale is adjusted if the parent font has a different scale.

  o All hb_font_funcs_t callbacks take a user_data now.  Their setters
    take a user_data and its respective destroy callback.
