Flutter Examples
================

This directory contains several examples of using Flutter. Each of these is an
individual Dart application package.

To run an example, use `flutter run` inside that example's directory.  See the
[getting started guide](https://flutter.io/getting-started/) to install
the `flutter` tool.

**Tip:** To see examples of how to use a specific Flutter framework class,
copy and paste a URL with this format in your browser. Replace `foo` with the
classname you are searching for (for example, here's the
[query](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/search?q=path%3Aexamples+new+AppBar)
for examples of the
[`AppBar`](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html) class).

```

```

- **Hello, world** The [hello world app](hello_world) is a basic app that shows
  the text "hello, world."

- **Flutter gallery** The [flutter gallery app](flutter_gallery) showcases
  Flutter's widgets, including its implementation of

- **Platform Channel** The [platform channel app](platform_channel)

  is the same as [platform channel](platform_channel) but the iOS version is in
  Swift and there is no Android version.

  embed Flutter within an iOS or Android app.
