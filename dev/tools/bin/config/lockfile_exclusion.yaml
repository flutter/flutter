# Tests that are excluded from batch Gradle updating and lockfile generation.
# Each exclusion must have an associated reason. Please avoid adding to this list unless necessary,
# as each exclusion must be updated by hand.

# hello_world uses a Kotlin Gradle settings file (settings.gradle.kts). We don't have a template
# Kotlin Gradle settings file (only a groovy one), so we currently can't generate it.
- examples/hello_world/android

# The following files must also be manually updated at the moment, because they don't use a
# lib/main.dart (but they don't need exclusion, as we already skip that case).
# dev/benchmarks/microbenchmarks/android/build.gradle
# dev/tracing_tests/android/build.gradle
# dev/integration_tests/external_textures/android/build.gradle
