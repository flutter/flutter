# Describes the tasks we run in the continuous integration (CI) environment.
#
# Cocoon[1] uses this file to generate a checklist of tasks to be performed for
# every master commit.

# [1] github.com/flutter/cocoon

# CI tasks.
#
# Each key in this dictionary is the unique name of a task, which also
# corresponds to a file in the "bin/" directory that the task runner will run.
#
# Required properties:
#
# * description: free form string
#       describes what the task is about
# * stage: one of "devicelab", "devicelab_ios", "devicelab_win"
#       tasks are grouped by stage so they appear next to each on the dashboard and have a distinct
#       icon attached to them. Stages can be used to create dependencies, e.g. we may decide to not
#       run device tests on red Cirrus builds.
# * required_agent_capabilities: a list of strings
#       list of capabilities a devicelab agent must have to be able to run this task.
#
# Optional properties:
#
# * flaky: boolean true or false
#       whether the task is considered flaky; the result of running a flaky task does not affect
#       the overall build status. Tests should be marked flaky when newly added, until they have
#       been proved for a few cycles. Tests that are actually flaky but not being actively worked
#       on should be hidden because they just cause confusion otherwise.
# * on_luci: boolean true or false
#       whether the task runs on LUCI builders. Tests will be gradually marked on_luci during the
#       devicelab to LUCI migration. And when the migration is complete, on_luci flag will be
#       removed.
