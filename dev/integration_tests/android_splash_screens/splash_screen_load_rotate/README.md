# Splash Demo: Never ending splash animation

This project is an example of a splash screen that displays an animation indefinitely.

A never-ending animation is provided as a demo so that developers can manually verify that
orientation changes and other UI destruction processes do not cause issues with Flutter's splash
system for Android.
