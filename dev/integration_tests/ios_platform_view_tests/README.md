# ios_platform_view_test

A simple app contains:

* A home with a button that pushes a new page into the scene.
* A page contains a platform view, a button, and a text.
    * Press the button will update the text.

We use this app to test platform views in general such as platform view creation, destruction, and thread merging(iOS only).
