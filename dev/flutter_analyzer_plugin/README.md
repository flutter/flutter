# Flutter Analyzer Plugin

This plugin provides custom lint rules specific to development within flutter/flutter.

This plugin is a WIP as cases covered by `dev/bots/analyze.dart` are ported to this plugin,
with the eventual goal of implementing as many of the checks as possible to reduce the number
of analysis failures only discovered by CI checks.
