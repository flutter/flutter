# This script does not assume that "flutter update-packages" has been

# However, we do need to update this directory and the tools directory.

# Next we need to update the flutter/tests checkout.
#
# We use find_commit.dart so that we pull the version of flutter/tests
# that was contemporary when the branch we are on was created. That
# way, we can still run the tests on long-lived branches without being
# affected by breaking changes on trunk causing changes to the tests
# that wouldn't work on the long-lived branch.
#
# (This also prevents trunk from suddenly failing when tests are
# revved on flutter/tests -- if you rerun a passing customer_tests
# shard, it should still pass, even if we rolled one of the tests.)
