// Loosely based off of
// https://github.com/android/user-interface-samples/blob/main/WindowInsetsAnimation/app/src/main/java/com/google/android/samples/insetsanimation/RootViewDeferringInsetsCallback.kt
//
// When the IME is shown or hidden, it immediately sends an onApplyWindowInsets call
// with the final state of the IME. This initial call disrupts the animation, which
// causes a flicker in the beginning.
//
// To fix this, this class extends WindowInsetsAnimation.Callback and implements
// OnApplyWindowInsetsListener. We capture and defer the initial call to
// onApplyWindowInsets while the animation completes. When the animation
// finishes, we can then release the call by invoking it in the onEnd callback
//
// The WindowInsetsAnimation.Callback extension forwards the new state of the
// IME inset from onProgress() to the framework. We also make use of the
// onStart callback to detect which calls to onApplyWindowInsets would
// interrupt the animation and defer it.
//
// By implementing OnApplyWindowInsetsListener, we are able to capture Android's
// attempts to call the FlutterView's onApplyWindowInsets. When a call to onStart
// occurs, we can mark any non-animation calls to onApplyWindowInsets() that
// occurs between prepare and start as deferred by using this class' wrapper
// implementation to cache the WindowInsets passed in and turn the current call into
// a no-op. When onEnd indicates the end of the animation, the deferred call is
// dispatched again, this time avoiding any flicker since the animation is now
// complete.

// This class should have "package private" visibility cause it's called from TextInputPlugin.
