/**
 * Delegate that implements all Flutter logic that is the same between a {@link FlutterActivity} and
 * a {@link FlutterFragment}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why does this class exist?</strong>
 *
 * <p>One might ask why an {@code Activity} and {@code Fragment} delegate needs to exist. Given that
 * a {@code Fragment} can be placed within an {@code Activity}, it would make more sense to use a
 * {@link FlutterFragment} within a {@link FlutterActivity}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Fragment} support library adds 100k of binary size to an app, and full-Flutter apps
 * do not otherwise require that binary hit. Therefore, it was concluded that Flutter must provide a
 * {@link FlutterActivity} based on the AOSP {@code Activity}, and an independent {@link
 * FlutterFragment} for add-to-app developers.
 *
 * <p>If a time ever comes where the inclusion of {@code Fragment}s in a full-Flutter app is no
 * longer deemed an issue, this class should be immediately decomposed between {@link
 * FlutterActivity} and {@link FlutterFragment} and then eliminated.
 *
 * <p><strong>Caution when modifying this class</strong>
 *
 * <p>Any time that a "delegate" is created with the purpose of encapsulating the internal behaviors
 * of another object, that delegate is highly susceptible to degeneration. It is easy to tack new
 * responsibilities on to the delegate which would not otherwise be added to the original object. It
 * is also easy to begin hanging listeners and callbacks on a delegate object that likewise would
 * not be added to the original object. A delegate can quickly become a complex web of dependencies
 * and optional references that are very difficult to track.
 *
 * <p>Maintainers of this class should take care to only place code in this delegate that would
 * otherwise be placed in either {@link FlutterActivity} or {@link FlutterFragment}, and in exactly
 * the same form. <strong>Do not use this class as a convenient shortcut for any other
 * behavior.</strong>
