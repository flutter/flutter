/**
 * Interface between Flutter embedding's Java code and Flutter engine's C/C++ code.
 *
 * <p>Flutter's engine is built with C/C++. The Android Flutter embedding is responsible for
 * coordinating Android OS events and app user interactions with the C/C++ engine. Such coordination
 * requires messaging from an Android app in Java code to the C/C++ engine code. This communication
 * requires a JNI (Java Native Interface) API to cross the Java/native boundary.
 *
 * <p>The entirety of Flutter's JNI API is codified in {@code FlutterJNI}. There are multiple
 * reasons that all such calls are centralized in one class. First, JNI calls are inherently static
 * and contain no Java implementation, therefore there is little reason to associate calls with
 * different classes. Second, every JNI call must be registered in C/C++ code and this registration
 * becomes more complicated with every additional Java class that contains JNI calls. Third, most
 * Android developers are not familiar with native development or JNI intricacies, therefore it is
 * in the interest of future maintenance to reduce the API surface that includes JNI declarations.
 * Thus, all Flutter JNI calls are centralized in {@code FlutterJNI}.
 *
 * <p>Despite the fact that individual JNI calls are inherently static, there is state that exists
 * within {@code FlutterJNI}. Most calls within {@code FlutterJNI} correspond to a specific
 * "platform view", of which there may be many. Therefore, each {@code FlutterJNI} instance holds
 * onto a "native platform view ID" after {@link #attachToNative()}, which is shared with the native
 * C/C++ engine code. That ID is passed to every platform-view-specific native method. ID management
 * is handled within {@code FlutterJNI} so that developers don't have to hold onto that ID.
 *
 * <p>To connect part of an Android app to Flutter's C/C++ engine, instantiate a {@code FlutterJNI}
 * and then attach it to the native side:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Instantiate FlutterJNI and attach to the native side.
 * FlutterJNI flutterJNI = new FlutterJNI();
 * flutterJNI.attachToNative();
 *
 * // Use FlutterJNI as desired. flutterJNI.dispatchPointerDataPacket(...);
 *
 * // Destroy the connection to the native side and cleanup.
 * flutterJNI.detachFromNativeAndReleaseResources();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To receive callbacks for certain events that occur on the native side, register listeners:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #addEngineLifecycleListener(FlutterEngine.EngineLifecycleListener)}
 *   <li>{@link #addIsDisplayingFlutterUiListener(FlutterUiDisplayListener)}
 * </ol>
 *
 * To facilitate platform messages between Java and Dart running in Flutter, register a handler:
 *
 * <p>{@link #setPlatformMessageHandler(PlatformMessageHandler)}
 *
 * <p>To invoke a native method that is not associated with a platform view, invoke it statically:
 *
 * <p>{@code bool enabled = FlutterJNI.getIsSoftwareRenderingEnabled(); }
