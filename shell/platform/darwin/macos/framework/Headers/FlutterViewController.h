/**
 * Controls a view that displays Flutter content and manages input.
 *
 * A FlutterViewController works with a FlutterEngine. Upon creation, the view
 * controller is always added to an engine, either a given engine, or it implicitly
 * creates an engine and add itself to that engine.
 *
 * The FlutterEngine assigns each view controller attached to it a unique ID.
 * Each view controller corresponds to a view, and the ID is used by the framework
 * to specify which view to operate.
 *
 * A FlutterViewController can also be unattached to an engine after it is manually
 * unset from the engine, or transiently during the initialization process.
 * An unattached view controller is invalid. Whether the view controller is attached
 * can be queried using FlutterViewController#attached.
 *
 * The FlutterViewController strongly references the FlutterEngine, while
 * the engine weakly the view controller. When a FlutterViewController is deallocated,
 * it automatically removes itself from its attached engine. When a FlutterEngine
 * has no FlutterViewControllers attached, it might shut down itself or not depending
 * on its configuration.
