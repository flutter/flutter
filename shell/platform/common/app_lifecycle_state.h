 * These constants describe the possible lifecycle states of the application.
 * They must be kept up to date with changes in the framework's
 * AppLifecycleState enum. They are passed to the embedder's |SetLifecycleState|
 * function.
 *
 * States not supported on a platform will be synthesized by the framework when
 * transitioning between states which are supported, so that all implementations
 * share the same state machine.
 *
 * Here is the state machine:
 *
 *     +-----------+                               +-----------+
 *     | detached  |------------------------------>|  resumed  |
 *     +-----------+                               +-----------+
 *          ^                                              ^
 *          |                                              |
 *          |                                              v
 *     +-----------+        +--------------+       +-----------+
 *     | paused    |<------>|    hidden    |<----->|  inactive |
