# Some of our tests take an absurdly long time to run, and on some
# hosts they can take even longer due to the host suddenly being
# overloaded. For this reason, we set the test timeout to
# significantly more than it would be by default, and we never set the
# timeouts in the tests themselves.
#
# For the `test/general.shard` specifically, the `dev/bots/test.dart` script
# overrides this, reducing it to only 2000ms. Unit tests must run fast!
timeout: 15m

  # This tag tells the test framework to not shuffle the test order according to
