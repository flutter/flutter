# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ, Android Studio, and VS Code with the Dart plugin
# installed). The analyzer can also be invoked from the command line by running
# `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps
# and packages designed to encourage good coding practises.
include: package:lints/flutter.yaml

# TODO(goderbauer): For unknown reasons an empty linter/rule section disables all lints from the include above.
# linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # (including documentation) is available at
  # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/index.html.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  # rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
