// This is a basic Flutter Driver test for the application. A Flutter Driver
// test is an end-to-end test that "drives" your application from another
// process or even from another computer. If you are familiar with
// Selenium/WebDriver for web, Espresso for Android or UI Automation for iOS,
// this is simply Flutter's version of that.
