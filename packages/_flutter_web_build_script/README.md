This package contains the custom build script used to compile Flutter for Web applications before support for JavaScript was added into the frontend_server. It is still used for test compilation today and is hosted here to reduce the number of dependencies that the flutter_tool has. For more information on the plans for flutter test --platform=chrome, see https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/50594
