///
/// ## Golden File Testing
///
/// The term __golden file__ refers to a master image that is considered the true
/// rendering of a given widget, state, application, or other visual
/// representation you have chosen to capture.
///
/// The master golden image files that are tested against can be created or
/// updated by running `flutter test --update-goldens` on the test.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// Sample invocations of [matchesGoldenFile].
///
/// ```dart
/// await expectLater(
///   find.text('Save'),
///   matchesGoldenFile('save.png'),
/// );
///
/// await expectLater(
///   image,
///   matchesGoldenFile('save.png'),
/// );
///
/// await expectLater(
///   imageFuture,
///   matchesGoldenFile(
///     'save.png',
///     version: 2,
///   ),
/// );
///
/// await expectLater(
///   find.byType(MyWidget),
///   matchesGoldenFile('goldens/myWidget.png'),
/// );
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// {@template flutter.flutter_test.matchesGoldenFile.custom_fonts}
/// ## Including Fonts
///
/// Custom fonts may render differently across different platforms, or
/// between different versions of Flutter. For example, a golden file generated
/// on Windows with fonts will likely differ from the one produced by another
/// operating system. Even on the same platform, if the generated golden is
/// tested with a different Flutter version, the test may fail and require an
/// updated image.
///
/// By default, the Flutter framework uses a font called 'Ahem' which shows
/// squares instead of characters, however, it is possible to render images using
/// custom fonts. For example, this is how to load the 'Roboto' font for a
/// golden test:
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// How to load a custom font for golden images.
/// ```dart
/// testWidgets('Creating a golden image with a custom font', (WidgetTester tester) async {
///   // Assuming the 'Roboto.ttf' file is declared in the pubspec.yaml file
///   final Future<ByteData> font = rootBundle.load('path/to/font-file/Roboto.ttf');
///
///   final FontLoader fontLoader = FontLoader('Roboto')..addFont(font);
///   await fontLoader.load();
///
///   await tester.pumpWidget(const MyWidget());
///
///   await expectLater(
///     find.byType(MyWidget),
///     matchesGoldenFile('myWidget.png'),
///   );
/// });
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// The example above loads the desired font only for that specific test. To load
/// a font for all golden file tests, the `FontLoader.load()` call could be
/// moved in the `flutter_test_config.dart`. In this way, the font will always be
/// loaded before a test:
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// Loading a custom font from the flutter_test_config.dart file.
/// ```dart
/// Future<void> testExecutable(FutureOr<void> Function() testMain) async {
///   setUpAll(() async {
///     final FontLoader fontLoader = FontLoader('SomeFont')..addFont(someFont);
///     await fontLoader.load();
///   });
