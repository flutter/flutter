/// Runs the [callback] inside the Flutter test environment.

///
/// The callback can be asynchronous (using `async`/`await` or
/// using explicit [Future]s).
///
/// There are two kinds of timeouts that can be specified. The `timeout`
/// argument specifies the backstop timeout implemented by the `test` package.
/// If set, it should be relatively large (minutes). It defaults to ten minutes
/// for tests run by `flutter test`, and is unlimited for tests run by `flutter
/// run`; specifically, it defaults to
/// [TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.defaultTestTimeout].
///
/// The `initialTimeout` argument specifies the timeout implemented by the
/// `flutter_test` package itself. If set, it may be relatively small (seconds),
/// as it is automatically increased for some expensive operations, and can also
/// be manually increased by calling
/// [AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.addTime]. The effective maximum value of
/// this timeout (even after calling `addTime`) is the one specified by the
/// `timeout` argument.
///
/// In general, timeouts are race conditions and cause flakes, so best practice
/// is to avoid the use of timeouts in tests.
///
/// If the `semanticsEnabled` parameter is set to `true`,
/// [WidgetTester.ensureSemantics] will have been called before the tester is
/// passed to the `callback`, and that handle will automatically be disposed
/// after the callback is finished. It defaults to true.
///
/// This function uses the [test] function in the test package to
/// register the given callback as a test. The callback, when run,
/// will be given a new instance of [WidgetTester]. The [find] object
/// provides convenient widget [Finder]s for use with the
/// [WidgetTester].
///
/// When the [variant] argument is set, [testWidgets] will run the test once for
/// each value of the [TestVariant.values]. If [variant] is not set, the test
/// will be run once using the base test environment.
///
/// If the [tags] are passed, they declare user-defined tags that are implemented by
/// the `test` package.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.addTime] to learn more about
///    timeout and how to manually increase timeouts.
