/// ## What is Golden File Testing?
///
/// The term __golden file__ refers to a master image that is considered the true
/// rendering of a given widget, state, application, or other visual
/// representation you have chosen to capture.
///
/// By keeping a master reference of visual aspects of your application, you can
/// prevent unintended changes as you develop by testing against them.
///
/// Here, a minor code change has altered the appearance of a widget. A golden
/// file test has compared the image generated at the time of the test to the
/// golden master file that was generated earlier. The test has identified the
/// change, preventing unintended modifications.
///
