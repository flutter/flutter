    // is looking at env var (FLUTTER_VM_URL) and connecting to app via VM service protocol. so really flutter_driver test is a dart script and you are running from host machine.
    // there, adb is available. platform channels or ffi or dart:ui, then it has to be integration_test, flutter, flutter_test (things running on device)
