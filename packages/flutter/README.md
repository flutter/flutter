# Flutter

Flutter is a new way to build high-performance, cross-platform mobile, web,
and desktop apps. Flutter is optimized for today's — and tomorrow's — mobile
and desktop devices. We are focused on low-latency input and high frame rates
on all platforms.

See the [getting started guide](https://flutter.dev/getting-started/) for
