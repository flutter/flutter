/// Defines the strut, which sets the minimum height a line can be
/// relative to the baseline.
///
/// Strut applies to all lines in the paragraph. Strut is a feature that
/// allows minimum line heights to be set. The effect is as if a zero
/// width space was included at the beginning of each line in the
/// paragraph. This imaginary space is 'shaped' according the properties
/// defined in this class. Flutter's strut is based on
/// [typesetting strut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strut_(typesetting))
/// and CSS's [line-height](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#line-height).
///
/// No lines may be shorter than the strut. The ascent and descent of the
/// strut are calculated, and any laid out text that has a shorter ascent or
/// descent than the strut's ascent or descent will take the ascent and
/// descent of the strut. Text with ascents or descents larger than the
/// strut's ascent or descent will layout as normal and extend past the strut.
///
/// Strut is defined independently from any text content or [TextStyle]s.
///
/// The vertical components of strut are as follows:
///
///  * Half the font-defined leading
///  * `ascent * height`
///  * `descent * height`
///  * Half the font-defined leading
///
/// The sum of these four values is the total height of the line.
///
/// Ascent is the font's spacing above the baseline without leading and
/// descent is the spacing below the baseline without leading. Leading is
/// split evenly between the top and bottom. The values for `ascent` and
/// `descent` are provided by the font named by [fontFamily]. If no
/// [fontFamily] or [fontFamilyFallback] is provided, then the platform's
/// default family will be used. Many fonts will have leading values of
/// zero, so in practice, the leading component is often irrelevant.
///
/// When [height] is omitted or null, then the font defined ascent and descent
/// will be used. The font's combined ascent and descent may be taller or
/// shorter than the [fontSize]. When [height] is provided, the line's EM-square
/// ascent and descent (which sums to [fontSize]) will be scaled by [height] to
/// achieve a final line height of `fontSize * height + fontSize * leading`
/// logical pixels. The proportion of ascent:descent with [height] specified
/// is the same as the font metrics defined ascent:descent ratio.
///
/// ![Text height diagram](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_height_diagram.png)
///
/// Each line's spacing above the baseline will be at least as tall as the
/// half leading plus ascent. Each line's spacing below the baseline will
/// be at least as tall as the half leading plus descent.
///
/// See also:
///

/// ### Fields and their default values.

// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// The defaults are noted here for convenience. The actual place where they //
// are defined is in the engine paragraph_style.h of LibTxt. The values here//
// should be updated should it change in the engine. The engine specifies   //
// the defaults in order to reduce the amount of data we pass to native as  //
// strut will usually be unspecified.                                       //
// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

///
/// Omitted or null properties will take the default values specified below:
///
///  * [fontFamily]: the name of the font to use when calculating the strut
///    (e.g., Roboto). No glyphs from the font will be drawn and the font will
///    be used purely for metrics.
///
///  * [fontFamilyFallback]: an ordered list of font family names that will
///    be searched for when the font in [fontFamily] cannot be found. When
///    all specified font families have been exhausted an no match was found,
///    the default platform font will be used.
///
///  * [fontSize]: the size of the ascent plus descent in logical pixels. This
///    is also used as the basis of the custom leading calculation. This value
///    cannot be negative.
///    Default is 14 logical pixels.
///
///  * [height]: the multiple of [fontSize] the line's height should be.
///    The line's height will take the font's ascent and descent values if
///    [height] is omitted or null. If provided, the EM-square ascent and
///    descent (which sum to [fontSize]) is scaled by [height].
///    The [height] will impact the spacing above and below the baseline
///    differently depending on the ratios between the font's ascent and
///    descent. This property is separate from the leading multiplier, which
///    is controlled through [leading].
///    Default is null.
///
///  * [leading]: the custom leading to apply to the strut as a multiple of
///    [fontSize]. Leading is additional spacing between lines. Half of the
///    leading is added to the top and the other half to the bottom of the
///    line height. This differs from [height] since the spacing is equally
///    distributed above and below the baseline.
///    Default is null, which will use the font-specified leading.
///
///  * [fontWeight]: the typeface thickness to use when calculating the strut
///    (e.g., bold).
///    Default is [FontWeight.w400].
///
///  * [fontStyle]: the typeface variant to use when calculating the strut
///    (e.g., italic).
///    Default is [FontStyle.normal].
///
///  * [forceStrutHeight]: when true, all lines will be laid out with the
///    height of the strut. All line and run-specific metrics will be
///    ignored/overridden and only strut metrics will be used instead.
///    This property guarantees uniform line spacing, however text in
///    adjacent lines may overlap. This property should be enabled with
///    caution as it bypasses a large portion of the vertical layout system.
///    The default value is false.
///
/// ### Examples
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// In this simple case, the text will be rendered at font size 10, however,
/// the vertical height of each line will be the strut height (Roboto in
/// font size 30 * 1.5) as the text itself is shorter than the strut.
///
/// ```dart
/// const Text(
///   'Hello, world!\nSecond line!',
///   style: TextStyle(
///     fontSize: 10,
///     fontFamily: 'Raleway',
///   ),
///   strutStyle: StrutStyle(
///     fontFamily: 'Roboto',
///     fontSize: 30,
///     height: 1.5,
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// Here, strut is used to absorb the additional line height in the second line.
/// The strut [height] was defined as 1.5 (the default font size is 14), which
/// caused all lines to be laid out taller than without strut. This extra space
/// was able to accommodate the larger font size of `Second line!` without
/// causing the line height to change for the second line only. All lines in
/// this example are thus the same height (`14 * 1.5`).
///
/// ```dart
/// const Text.rich(
///   TextSpan(
///     text: 'First line!\n',
