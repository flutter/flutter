    // Transforming the 4 corners of a rectangle the straightforward way

    // the points using 4 inversions of the homogeneous weight factor
    // and then 12 multiplies. Once we have transformed all of the points
    // we then need to turn them into a bounding box using 4 min/max
    // operations each on 4 values yielding 12 total comparisons.
    //
    // On top of all of those operations, using the vector_math package to
    // do the work for us involves allocating several objects in order to
    // communicate the values back and forth - 4 allocating getters to extract
    // the [Offset] objects for the corners of the [Rect], 4 conversions to
    // a [Vector3] to use [Matrix4.perspectiveTransform()], and then 4 new
    // [Offset] objects allocated to hold those results, yielding 8 [Offset]
    // and 4 [Vector3] object allocations per rectangle transformed.
    //
    // But the math we really need to get our answer is actually much less
    // than that.
    //
    // First, consider that a full point transform using the vector math
    // package involves expanding it out into a vector3 with a Z coordinate
    // of 0.0 and then performing 3 multiplies and 3 adds per coordinate:
    //
    //     xt = x*m00 + y*m10 + z*m20 + m30;
    //     yt = x*m01 + y*m11 + z*m21 + m31;
    //     zt = x*m02 + y*m12 + z*m22 + m32;
    //     wt = x*m03 + y*m13 + z*m23 + m33;
    //
    // Immediately we see that we can get rid of the 3rd column of multiplies
    // since we know that Z=0.0. We can also get rid of the 3rd row because
    // we ignore the resulting Z coordinate. Finally we can get rid of the
    // last row if we don't have a perspective transform since we can verify
    // that the results are 1.0 for all points. This gets us down to 16
    // multiplies and 16 adds in the non-perspective case and 24 of each for
    // the perspective case. (Plus the 12 comparisons to turn them back into
    // a bounding box.)
    //
    // But we can do even better than that.
    //
    // Under optimal conditions of no perspective transformation,
    // which is actually a very common condition, we can transform
    // a rectangle in as little as 3 operations:
    //
    // (rx,ry) = transform of upper left corner of rectangle
    // (wx,wy) = delta transform of the (w, 0) width relative vector
    // (hx,hy) = delta transform of the (0, h) height relative vector
    //
    // A delta transform is a transform of all elements of the matrix except
    // for the translation components. The translation components are added
    // in at the end of each transform computation so they represent a
    // constant offset for each point transformed. A delta transform of
    // a horizontal or vertical vector involves a single multiplication due
    // to the fact that it only has one non-zero coordinate and no addition
    // of the translation component.
    //
    // In the absence of a perspective transform, the transformed
    // rectangle will be mapped into a parallelogram with corners at:
    // corner1 = (rx, ry)
    // corner2 = corner1 + dTransformed width vector = (rx+wx, ry+wy)
    // corner3 = corner1 + dTransformed height vector = (rx+hx, ry+hy)
    // corner4 = corner1 + both dTransformed vectors = (rx+wx+hx, ry+wy+hy)
    // In all, this method of transforming the rectangle requires only
    // 8 multiplies and 12 additions (which we can reduce to 8 additions if
    // we only need a bounding box, see below).
    //
    // In the presence of a perspective transform, the above conditions
    // continue to hold with respect to the non-normalized coordinates so
    // we can still save a lot of multiplications by computing the 4
    // non-normalized coordinates using relative additions before we normalize
    // them and they lose their "pseudo-parallelogram" relationships. We still
    // have to do the normalization divisions and min/max all 4 points to
    // get the resulting transformed bounding box, but we save a lot of
    // calculations over blindly transforming all 4 coordinates independently.
    // In all, we need 12 multiplies and 22 additions to construct the
    // non-normalized vectors and then 8 divisions (or 4 inversions and 8
    // multiplies) for normalization (plus the standard set of 12 comparisons
    // for the min/max bounds operations).
    //
    // Back to the non-perspective case, the optimization that lets us get
    // away with fewer additions if we only need a bounding box comes from
    // analyzing the impact of the relative vectors on expanding the
    // bounding box of the parallelogram. First, the bounding box always
    // contains the transformed upper-left corner of the rectangle. Next,
    // each relative vector either pushes on the left or right side of the
    // bounding box and also either the top or bottom side, depending on
    // whether it is positive or negative. Finally, you can consider the
    // impact of each vector on the bounding box independently. If, say,
    // wx and hx have the same sign, then the limiting point in the bounding
    // box will be the one that involves adding both of them to the origin
    // point. If they have opposite signs, then one will push one wall one
    // way and the other will push the opposite wall the other way and when
    // you combine both of them, the resulting "opposite corner" will
    // actually be between the limits they established by pushing the walls
    // away from each other, as below:
    //

    //             +---------------(+wx+hx,+wy+hy)----------+
    //
    // In this diagram, consider that:
    //
    //  * wx would be a positive number
    //  * hx would be a negative number
    //  * wy and hy would both be positive numbers
    //
    // As a result, wx pushes out the right wall, hx pushes out the left wall,
    // and both wy and hy push down the bottom wall of the bounding box. The
    // wx,hx pair (of opposite signs) worked on opposite walls and the final
    // opposite corner had an X coordinate between the limits they established.
    // The wy,hy pair (of the same sign) both worked together to push the
    // bottom wall down by their sum.
    //
    // This relationship allows us to simply start with the point computed by
    // transforming the upper left corner of the rectangle, and then
    // conditionally adding wx, wy, hx, and hy to either the left or top
    // or right or bottom of the bounding box independently depending on sign.
    // In that case we only need 4 comparisons and 4 additions total to
    // compute the bounding box, combined with the 8 multiplications and
    // 4 additions to compute the transformed point and relative vectors
    // for a total of 8 multiplies, 8 adds, and 4 comparisons.
    //
    // An astute observer will note that we do need to do 2 subtractions at
    // the top of the method to compute the width and height. Add those to
    // all of the relative solutions listed above. The test for perspective
    // also adds 3 compares to the affine case and up to 3 compares to the
    // perspective case (depending on which test fails, the rest are omitted).
    //
    // The final tally:
    // basic method          = 60 mul + 48 add + 12 compare
    // optimized perspective = 12 mul + 22 add + 15 compare + 2 sub
    // optimized affine      =  8 mul +  8 add +  7 compare + 2 sub
    //
    // Since compares are essentially subtractions and subtractions are
    // the same cost as adds, we end up with:

    // optimized perspective = 12 mul + 39 add/sub/compare
