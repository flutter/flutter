/// ### Bold
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// Here, a single line of text in a [Text] widget is given a specific style
/// override. The style is mixed with the ambient [DefaultTextStyle] by the
/// [Text] widget.
///
/// ![Applying the style in this way creates bold text.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_bold.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// const Text(
///   'No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan.',
///   style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ### Italics
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// As in the previous example, the [Text] widget is given a specific style
/// override which is implicitly mixed with the ambient [DefaultTextStyle].
///
/// ![This results in italicized text.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_italics.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// const Text(
///   "Welcome to the present, we're running a real nation.",
///   style: TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ### Opacity and Color
///
/// Each line here is progressively more opaque. The base color is
/// [material.Colors.black], and [Color.withOpacity] is used to create a
/// derivative color with the desired opacity. The root [TextSpan] for this
/// [RichText] widget is explicitly given the ambient [DefaultTextStyle], since
/// [RichText] does not do that automatically. The inner [TextStyle] objects are
/// implicitly mixed with the parent [TextSpan]'s [TextSpan.style].
///
/// If [color] is specified, [foreground] must be null and vice versa. [color] is
/// treated as a shorthand for `Paint()..color = color`.
///
/// If [backgroundColor] is specified, [background] must be null and vice versa.
/// The [backgroundColor] is treated as a shorthand for
/// `background: Paint()..color = backgroundColor`.
///
/// ![This results in three lines of text that go from lighter to darker in color.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_opacity_and_color.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// RichText(
///   text: TextSpan(
///     style: DefaultTextStyle.of(context).style,
///     children: <TextSpan>[
///       TextSpan(
///         text: "You don't have the votes.\n",
///         style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.6)),
///       ),
///       TextSpan(
///         text: "You don't have the votes!\n",
///         style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.8)),

///         style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(1.0)),
///       ),
///     ],
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ### Size
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// In this example, the ambient [DefaultTextStyle] is explicitly manipulated to
/// obtain a [TextStyle] that doubles the default font size.
///
/// ![This results in text that is twice as large as normal.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_size.png)

///   style: DefaultTextStyle.of(context).style.apply(fontSizeFactor: 2.0),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ### Line height
///
/// By default, text will layout with line height as defined by the font.
/// Font-metrics defined line height may be taller or shorter than the font size.
/// The [height] property allows manual adjustment of the height of the line as
/// a multiple of [fontSize]. For most fonts, setting [height] to 1.0 is not
/// the same as omitting or setting height to null. The following diagram
/// illustrates the difference between the font-metrics-defined line height and
/// the line height produced with `height: 1.0` (also known as the EM-square):
///
/// ![With the font-metrics-defined line height, there is space between lines appropriate for the font, whereas the EM-square is only the height required to hold most of the characters.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_height_diagram.png)
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// The [height] property can be used to change the line height. Here, the line
/// height is set to 5 times the font size, so that the text is very spaced out.
/// Since the `fontSize` is set to 10, the final height of the line is
/// 50 pixels.
///
/// ```dart
/// const Text(
///   'Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but you’re here with us in New York City.',
///   style: TextStyle(height: 5, fontSize: 10),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// Examples of the resulting heights from different values of `TextStyle.height`:
///
/// ![Since the explicit line height is applied as a scale factor on the font-metrics-defined line height, the gap above the text grows faster, as the height grows, than the gap below the text.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_height_comparison_diagram.png)
///
/// See [StrutStyle] for further control of line height at the paragraph level.
///
/// ### Leading Distribution and Trimming
///
/// [Leading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading) is the vertical space
/// between glyphs from adjacent lines. Quantitatively, it is the line height
/// (see the previous section) subtracted by the font's ascent and descent.
/// It's possible to have a negative `Leading` if [height] is sufficiently
/// small.
///
/// When the [height] multiplier is null, `leading` and how it is distributed
/// is up to the font's
/// [metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface#Font_metrics).
/// When the [height] multiplier is specified, the exact behavior can be
/// configured via [leadingDistribution] and [TextPainter.textHeightBehavior].
///
/// ![In configuration 1 the line height is divided by the alphabetic baseline proportionally to the font's ascent and descent, in configuration 3 the glyphs are roughly centered within the line height, configuration 2 is similar to configuration 1 except the Text Top guide on the same line as the font's ascent](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_height_breakdown.png)
///
/// Above is a side-by-side comparison of different [leadingDistribution] and
/// [TextPainter.textHeightBehavior] combinations.
///
///  * Configuration 1: The default. [leadingDistribution] is set to [TextLeadingDistribution.proportional].
///  * Configuration 2: same as Configuration 1, except [TextHeightBehavior.applyHeightToFirstAscent] is set to false.
///  * Configuration 3: [leadingDistribution] is set to [TextLeadingDistribution.even].
///  * Configuration 4: same as Configuration 3, except [TextHeightBehavior.applyHeightToLastDescent] is set to false.
///
/// The [leadingDistribution] property controls how leading is distributed over
/// and under the text. With [TextLeadingDistribution.proportional]
/// (Configuration 1), `Top Leading : Bottom Leading = Font Ascent : Font
/// Descent`, which also means the alphabetic baseline divides the line height
/// into 2 parts proportional to the font's ascent and descent. With
/// [TextLeadingDistribution.even] (Configuration 3), `Top Leading` equals
/// `Bottom Leading`, and the glyphs are roughly centered within the allotted
/// line height.
///
/// The [TextPainter.textHeightBehavior] is a property that controls leading at
/// the paragraph level. The `applyHeightToFirstAscent` property is applied
/// **after** [height] and [leadingDistribution]. Setting it to false trims the
/// "Top Leading" of the text box to match the font's ascent if it's on the
/// first line (see Configuration 2). Similarly setting
/// `applyHeightToLastDescent` to false reduces "Bottom Leading" to 0 for the
/// last line of text (Configuration 4).
///
/// ### Wavy red underline with black text
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// Styles can be combined. In this example, the misspelled word is drawn in
/// black text and underlined with a wavy red line to indicate a spelling error.
/// (The remainder is styled according to the Flutter default text styles, not
/// the ambient [DefaultTextStyle], since no explicit style is given and
/// [RichText] does not automatically use the ambient [DefaultTextStyle].)
///
/// ![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_wavy_red_underline.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// RichText(
///   text: const TextSpan(
///     text: "Don't tax the South ",
///     children: <TextSpan>[
///       TextSpan(
///         text: 'cuz',
///         style: TextStyle(
///           color: Colors.black,
///           decoration: TextDecoration.underline,

/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ### Borders and stroke (Foreground)
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// To create bordered text, a [Paint] with [Paint.style] set to [PaintingStyle.stroke]
/// should be provided as a [foreground] paint. The following example uses a [Stack]
/// to produce a stroke and fill effect.
///
/// ![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/text_border.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// Stack(
///   children: <Widget>[
///     // Stroked text as border.
///     Text(
///       'Greetings, planet!',
///       style: TextStyle(
///         fontSize: 40,
///         foreground: Paint()
///           ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
///           ..strokeWidth = 6
///           ..color = Colors.blue[700]!,
///       ),
///     ),
///     // Solid text as fill.
///     Text(
///       'Greetings, planet!',
///       style: TextStyle(
///         fontSize: 40,
///         color: Colors.grey[300],
///       ),
///     ),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ### Gradients (Foreground)
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// The [foreground] property also allows effects such as gradients to be
/// applied to the text. Here we provide a [Paint] with a [Gradient]
/// shader.
///
/// ![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/text_gradient.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// Text(
///   'Greetings, planet!',
///   style: TextStyle(
///     fontSize: 40,
///     foreground: Paint()
///       ..shader = ui.Gradient.linear(
///         const Offset(0, 20),
///         const Offset(150, 20),
///         <Color>[
///           Colors.red,
///           Colors.yellow,
///         ],
///       )
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ### Custom Fonts
///
/// Custom fonts can be declared in the `pubspec.yaml` file as shown below:
///
/// ```yaml
/// flutter:
///   fonts:
///     - family: Raleway
///       fonts:
///         - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
///         - asset: fonts/Raleway-Medium.ttf
///           weight: 500
///         - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-SemiBold.ttf
///           weight: 600
///      - family: Schyler
///        fonts:
///          - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
///          - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
///            style: italic
/// ```
///
/// The `family` property determines the name of the font, which you can use in
/// the [fontFamily] argument. The `asset` property is a path to the font file,
/// relative to the `pubspec.yaml` file. The `weight` property specifies the
/// weight of the glyph outlines in the file as an integer multiple of 100
/// between 100 and 900. This corresponds to the [FontWeight] class and can be
/// used in the [fontWeight] argument. The `style` property specifies whether the
/// outlines in the file are `italic` or `normal`. These values correspond to
/// the [FontStyle] class and can be used in the [fontStyle] argument.
///
/// To select a custom font, create [TextStyle] using the [fontFamily]
/// argument as shown in the example below:
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// ![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_custom_fonts.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// const TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Raleway')
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// To use a font family defined in a package, the `package` argument must be
/// provided. For instance, suppose the font declaration above is in the
/// `pubspec.yaml` of a package named `my_package` which the app depends on.
/// Then creating the TextStyle is done as follows:
///
/// ```dart
/// const TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Raleway', package: 'my_package')
/// ```
///
/// If the package internally uses the font it defines, it should still specify
/// the `package` argument when creating the text style as in the example above.
///
/// A package can also provide font files without declaring a font in its
/// `pubspec.yaml`. These files should then be in the `lib/` folder of the
/// package. The font files will not automatically be bundled in the app, instead
/// the app can use these selectively when declaring a font. Suppose a package
/// named `my_package` has:
///
///     lib/fonts/Raleway-Medium.ttf
///
/// Then the app can declare a font like in the example below:
///
/// ```yaml
/// flutter:
///   fonts:
///     - family: Raleway
///       fonts:
///         - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
///         - asset: packages/my_package/fonts/Raleway-Medium.ttf
///           weight: 500
/// ```
///
/// The `lib/` is implied, so it should not be included in the asset path.
///
/// In this case, since the app locally defines the font, the TextStyle is
/// created without the `package` argument:
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// ```dart
/// const TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Raleway')
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// #### Supported font formats
///
/// Font formats currently supported by Flutter:
///
///  * `.ttc`
///  * `.ttf`
///  * `.otf`
///
/// Flutter does not support `.woff` and `.woff2` fonts for all platforms.
///
/// ### Custom Font Fallback
///
/// A custom [fontFamilyFallback] list can be provided. The list should be an
/// ordered list of strings of font family names in the order they will be attempted.
///
/// The fonts in [fontFamilyFallback] will be used only if the requested glyph is
/// not present in the [fontFamily].
///
/// The fallback order is:
///
///  * [fontFamily]
///  * [fontFamilyFallback] in order of first to last.
///  * System fallback fonts which will vary depending on platform.
///
/// The glyph used will always be the first matching version in fallback order.
///
/// The [fontFamilyFallback] property is commonly used to specify different font
/// families for multilingual text spans as well as separate fonts for glyphs such
/// as emojis.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// In the following example, any glyphs not present in the font `Raleway` will be attempted
/// to be resolved with `Noto Sans CJK SC`, and then with `Noto Color Emoji`:
///
/// ```dart
/// const TextStyle(
///   fontFamily: 'Raleway',
///   fontFamilyFallback: <String>[
///     'Noto Sans CJK SC',
///     'Noto Color Emoji',
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// If all custom fallback font families are exhausted and no match was found
/// or no custom fallback was provided, the platform font fallback will be used.
///
/// ### Inconsistent platform fonts
///
/// By default, fonts differ depending on the platform.
///
///  * The default font-family for `Android`,`Fuchsia` and `Linux` is `Roboto`.
///  * The default font-family for `iOS` is `SF Pro Display`/`SF Pro Text`.
///  * The default font-family for `MacOS` is `.AppleSystemUIFont`.
///  * The default font-family for `Windows` is `Segoe UI`.
//
// The implementation of these defaults can be found in:
// /packages/flutter/lib/src/material/typography.dart
///
/// Since Flutter's font discovery for default fonts depends on the fonts present
/// on the device, it is not safe to assume all default fonts will be available or
/// consistent across devices.
///
/// A known example of this is that Samsung devices ship with a CJK font that has
/// smaller line spacing than the Android default. This results in Samsung devices
/// displaying more tightly spaced text than on other Android devices when no
/// custom font is specified.
///
/// To avoid this, a custom font should be specified if absolute font consistency
/// is required for your application.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Text], the widget for showing text in a single style.
///  * [DefaultTextStyle], the widget that specifies the default text styles for
///    [Text] widgets, configured using a [TextStyle].
///  * [RichText], the widget for showing a paragraph of mix-style text.
///  * [TextSpan], the class that wraps a [TextStyle] for the purposes of
///    passing it to a [RichText].
///  * [TextStyle](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/TextStyle-class.html), the class in the [dart:ui] library.

/// Interpolate between two lists of [FontVariation] objects.
///
/// Variations are paired by axis, and interpolated using [FontVariation.lerp].
///
/// Entries that are only present in one list are animated using a step-function
/// at t=0.5 that enables or disables the variation. This can be jarring and
/// largely defeats the point of animating font variations. For best results,
/// specify the same axes in both lists, and for best performance, specify them
/// in the same order.
///
/// ## Performance details
///
/// This algorithm is O(N), but the constant factor varies based on the input,
/// and that is probably more important (because typically N is going to be
/// tiny, like 1 or 2; at the time of writing, there are only about five defined
/// axes that fonts typically use!).
///
/// It is fastest when the lists contain the same axes ([FontVariation.axis]) in
/// the same order. The result is again in the same order, and no attempt is
/// made to detect or remove duplicates in this process. This is, by far, the
/// recommended way to use this algorithm.
///
/// When the order of items in the two input lists vary, the constant factor
/// increases substantially, as it involves creating two maps and a set,
/// inserting every variation in both lists into the maps and the set, and then
/// iterating over them to recreate the list.
///
/// In this case, the resulting order is arbitrary. Duplicates are dropped; in
/// each list, the last [FontVariation] for any particular axis is the one used
/// to compute the value for that axis. Values that only appear on one side are
/// interpolated using [FontVariation.lerp] against a null value, and resulting
/// null values are omitted from the resulting list.
///
/// When the lists begin with matching pairs of axes, the fast algorithm is used
/// up to the point where the lists diverge, and the more expensive algorithm
/// is used on the remaining entries.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [TextStyle.lerp], which uses this function to handle
