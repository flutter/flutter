/// The [compute] method accepts the following parameters:
///
///  * `Q` is the type of the message that kicks off the computation.
///  * `R` is the type of the value returned.
///
/// There are limitations on the values that can be sent and received to and
/// from isolates. These limitations constrain the values of `Q` and `R` that
/// are possible. See the discussion at [SendPort.send].
