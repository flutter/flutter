/// An abstract node in a tree.
///
/// AbstractNode has as notion of depth, attachment, and parent, but does not
/// have a model for children.
///
/// When a subclass is changing the parent of a child, it should call either
/// `parent.adoptChild(child)` or `parent.dropChild(child)` as appropriate.
/// Subclasses can expose an API for manipulating the tree if desired (e.g. a
/// setter for a `child` property, or an `add()` method to manipulate a list).
///
/// The current parent node is exposed by the [parent] property.
///
/// The current attachment state is exposed by [attached]. The root of any tree
/// that is to be considered attached should be manually attached by calling
/// [attach]. Other than that, the [attach] and [detach] methods should not be
/// called directly; attachment is managed automatically by the aforementioned
/// [adoptChild] and [dropChild] methods.
///
/// Subclasses that have children must override [attach] and [detach] as
/// described in the documentation for those methods.
///
/// Nodes always have a [depth] greater than their ancestors'. There's no
/// guarantee regarding depth between siblings. The depth of a node is used to
/// ensure that nodes are processed in depth order. The [depth] of a child can
/// be more than one greater than the [depth] of the parent, because the [depth]
/// values are never decreased: all that matters is that it's greater than the
/// parent. Consider a tree with a root node A, a child B, and a grandchild C.
/// Initially, A will have [depth] 0, B [depth] 1, and C [depth] 2. If C is
/// moved to be a child of A, sibling of B, then the numbers won't change. C's
/// [depth] will still be 2. The [depth] is automatically maintained by the
/// [adoptChild] and [dropChild] methods.
