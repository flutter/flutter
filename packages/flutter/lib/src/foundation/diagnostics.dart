  ///  * [StringProperty], which supports automatically enclosing a [String]

  ///    formats it as a percentage.
  ///  * [IntProperty], which supports specifying a unit of measurement for an
  ///    [int] value.
  ///  * [FlagProperty], which formats a [bool] value as one or more flags.
  ///    Depending on the use case it is better to format a bool as
  ///    `DiagnosticsProperty<bool>` instead of using [FlagProperty] as the
  ///    output is more verbose but unambiguous.
  ///
  /// ## Other important [DiagnosticsProperty] variants
  ///
  ///  * [EnumProperty], which provides terse descriptions of enum values
  ///    working around limitations of the `toString` implementation for Dart
  ///    enum types.
  ///  * [IterableProperty], which handles iterable values with display
  ///    customizable depending on the [DiagnosticsTreeStyle] used.
  ///  * [ObjectFlagProperty], which provides terse descriptions of whether a
  ///    property value is present or not. For example, whether an `onClick`
  ///    callback is specified or an animation is in progress.
  ///  * [ColorProperty], which must be used if the property value is
  ///    a [Color] or one of its subclasses.
  ///  * [IconDataProperty], which must be used if the property value
  ///    is of type [IconData].
  ///
  /// If none of these subclasses apply, use the [DiagnosticsProperty]
  /// constructor or in rare cases create your own [DiagnosticsProperty]
  /// subclass as in the case for [TransformProperty] which handles [Matrix4]
  /// that represent transforms. Generally any property value with a good
  /// `toString` method implementation works fine using [DiagnosticsProperty]
  /// directly.
