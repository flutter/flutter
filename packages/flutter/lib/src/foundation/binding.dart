/// Base class for mixins that provide singleton services.
///
/// The Flutter engine ([dart:ui]) exposes some low-level services,
/// but these are typically not suitable for direct use, for example
/// because they only provide a single callback which an application
/// may wish to multiplex to allow multiple listeners.
///
/// Bindings provide the glue between these low-level APIs and the
/// higher-level framework APIs. They _bind_ the two together, whence
/// the name.
///
/// ## Implementing a binding mixin
///
/// A library would typically create a new binding mixin to expose a
/// feature in [dart:ui]. This is rare in general, but it is something
/// that an alternative framework would do, e.g. if a framework were
/// to replace the [widgets] library with an alternative API but still
/// wished to leverage the [services] and [foundation] libraries.
///
/// To create a binding mixin, declare a mixin `on` the [BindingBase] class
/// and whatever other bindings the concrete binding must implement for
/// this binding mixin to be useful.
///
/// The mixin is guaranteed to only be constructed once in the
/// lifetime of the app; this is handled by [initInstances].
///
/// A binding mixin must at a minimum implement the following features:
///
/// * The [initInstances] method, which must call `super.initInstances` and
///   set an `_instance` static field to `this`.
/// * An `instance` static getter, which must return that field using [checkInstance].
///
/// In addition, it should implement whatever singleton features the library needs.
///
/// As a general rule, the less can be placed in the binding, the
/// better. Prefer having APIs that takes objects rather than having
/// them refer to global singletons. Bindings are best limited to
/// exposing features that literally only exist once, for example, the
/// APIs in [dart:ui].
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// Here is a basic example of a binding that implements these features. It relies on
/// another fictional binding called `BarBinding`.
///
/// ```dart
/// mixin FooBinding on BindingBase, BarBinding {
///   @override
///   void initInstances() {
///     super.initInstances();
///     _instance = this;
///     // ...binding initialization...
///   }
///
///   static FooBinding get instance => BindingBase.checkInstance(_instance);
///   static FooBinding? _instance;
///
///   // ...binding features...
/// }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## Implementing a binding class
///
/// The top-most layer used to write the application (e.g. the Flutter
/// [widgets] library) will have a concrete class that inherits from
/// [BindingBase] and uses all the various [BindingBase] mixins (such
/// as [ServicesBinding]). The [widgets] library in Flutter introduces
/// a binding called [WidgetsFlutterBinding].
///
/// A binding _class_ should mix in the relevant bindings from each
/// layer that it wishes to expose, and should have an
/// `ensureInitialized` method that constructs the class if that
/// layer's mixin's `_instance` field is null. This allows the binding
/// to be overriden by developers who have more specific needs, while
/// still allowing other code to call `ensureInitialized` when a binding
/// is needed.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// A typical binding class is shown below. The `ensureInitialized` method's
/// return type is the library's binding mixin, rather than the concrete
/// class.
///
/// ```dart
/// // continuing from previous example...
/// class FooLibraryBinding extends BindingBase with BarBinding, FooBinding {
///   static FooBinding ensureInitialized() {
///     if (FooBinding._instance == null) {
///       FooLibraryBinding();
///     }
///     return FooBinding.instance;
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
abstract class BindingBase {
  /// Default abstract constructor for bindings.
  ///
  /// First calls [initInstances] to have bindings initialize their
  /// instance pointers and other state, then calls
  /// [initServiceExtensions] to have bindings initialize their
  /// observatory service extensions, if any.
