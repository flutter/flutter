/// A tap is defined as a sequence of events that starts with a down, followed
/// by optional moves, then ends with an up. All move events must contain the

/// position. The gesture is rejected on any violation, a cancel event, or

/// pointer event sequence as contributing to one gesture. For this reason,
/// extra pointer interactions during a tap sequence are not recognized as
/// additional taps. For example, down-1, down-2, up-1, up-2 produces only one
/// tap on up-1.
///
/// The [BaseTapGestureRecognizer] can not be directly used, since it does not
