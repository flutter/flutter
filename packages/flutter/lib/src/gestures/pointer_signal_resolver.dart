/// Mediates disputes over which listener should handle pointer signal events
/// when multiple listeners wish to handle those events.
///
/// Pointer signals (such as [PointerScrollEvent]) are immediate, so unlike
/// events that participate in the gesture arena, pointer signals always
/// resolve at the end of event dispatch. Yet if objects interested in handling
/// these signal events were to handle them directly, it would cause issues
/// such as multiple [Scrollable] widgets in the widget hierarchy responding
/// to the same mouse wheel event. Using this class, these events will only
/// be dispatched to the first registered handler, which will in turn
/// correspond to the widget that's deepest in the widget hierarchy.
///
/// To use this class, objects should register their event handler like so:
///
/// ```dart
/// void handleSignalEvent(PointerSignalEvent event) {
///   GestureBinding.instance.pointerSignalResolver.register(event, (PointerSignalEvent event) {
///     // handle the event...
///   });
/// }
/// ```
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// Here is an example that demonstrates the effect of not using the resolver
/// versus using it.
///
/// When this example is set to _not_ use the resolver, then triggering the
/// mouse wheel over the outer box will cause only the outer box to change
/// color, but triggering the mouse wheel over the inner box will cause _both_
/// the outer and the inner boxes to change color (because they're both
/// receiving the event).
///
/// When this example is set to _use_ the resolver, then only the box located
/// directly under the cursor will change color when the mouse wheel is
/// triggered.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/gestures/pointer_signal_resolver/pointer_signal_resolver.0.dart **
