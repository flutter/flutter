/// A Material Design icon button.
///
/// An icon button is a picture printed on a [Material] widget that reacts to
/// touches by filling with color (ink).
///
/// Icon buttons are commonly used in the [AppBar.actions] field, but they can
/// be used in many other places as well.
///
/// If the [onPressed] callback is null, then the button will be disabled and
/// will not react to touch.
///
/// Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget. In Material Design 3,
/// this requirement no longer exists because this widget builds a subclass of
/// [ButtonStyleButton].
///
/// The hit region of an icon button will, if possible, be at least
/// kMinInteractiveDimension pixels in size, regardless of the actual
/// [iconSize], to satisfy the [touch target size](https://material.io/design/layout/spacing-methods.html#touch-targets)
/// requirements in the Material Design specification. The [alignment] controls
/// how the icon itself is positioned within the hit region.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This sample shows an [IconButton] that uses the Material icon "volume_up" to
/// increase the volume.
///
/// ![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/icon_button.png)
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/icon_button/icon_button.0.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ### Icon sizes
///
/// When creating an icon button with an [Icon], do not override the
/// icon's size with its [Icon.size] parameter, use the icon button's
/// [iconSize] parameter instead. For example do this:
///
/// ```dart
/// IconButton(
///   iconSize: 72,
///   icon: const Icon(Icons.favorite),
///   onPressed: () {
///     // ...
///   },
/// ),
/// ```
///
/// Avoid doing this:
///
/// ```dart
/// IconButton(
///   icon: const Icon(Icons.favorite, size: 72),
///   onPressed: () {
///     // ...
///   },
/// ),
/// ```
///
/// If you do, the button's size will be based on the default icon
/// size, not 72, which may produce unexpected layouts and clipping
/// issues.
///
/// ### Adding a filled background
///
/// Icon buttons don't support specifying a background color or other
/// background decoration because typically the icon is just displayed
/// on top of the parent widget's background. Icon buttons that appear
/// in [AppBar.actions] are an example of this.
///
/// It's easy enough to create an icon button with a filled background
/// using the [Ink] widget. The [Ink] widget renders a decoration on
/// the underlying [Material] along with the splash and highlight
/// [InkResponse] contributed by descendant widgets.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// In this sample the icon button's background color is defined with an [Ink]
/// widget whose child is an [IconButton]. The icon button's filled background
/// is a light shade of blue, it's a filled circle, and it's as big as the
/// button is.
///
/// ![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/icon_button_background.png)
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/icon_button/icon_button.1.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// Material Design 3 introduced new types (standard and contained) of [IconButton]s.
/// The default [IconButton] is the standard type. To create a filled icon button,
/// use [IconButton.filled]; to create a filled tonal icon button, use [IconButton.filledTonal];
/// to create a outlined icon button, use [IconButton.outlined].
///
/// Material Design 3 also treats [IconButton]s as toggle buttons. In order
/// to not break existing apps, the toggle feature can be optionally controlled
/// by the [isSelected] property.
///
/// If [isSelected] is null it will behave as a normal button. If [isSelected] is not
/// null then it will behave as a toggle button. If [isSelected] is true then it will
/// show [selectedIcon], if it false it will show the normal [icon].
///
/// In Material Design 3, both [IconTheme] and [IconButtonTheme] are used to override the default style
/// of [IconButton]. If both themes exist, the [IconButtonTheme] will override [IconTheme] no matter
/// which is closer to the [IconButton]. Each [IconButton]'s property is resolved by the order of
/// precedence: widget property, [IconButtonTheme] property, [IconTheme] property and
/// internal default property value.
///
/// In Material Design 3, the [IconButton.visualDensity] defaults to [VisualDensity.standard]
/// for all platforms; otherwise the button will have a rounded rectangle shape if
/// the [IconButton.visualDensity] is set to [VisualDensity.compact]. Users can
/// customize it by using [IconButtonTheme], [IconButton.style] or [IconButton.visualDensity].
///
