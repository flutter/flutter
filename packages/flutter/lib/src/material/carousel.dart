/// A Material Design carousel widget.
///
/// The [CarouselView] presents a scrollable list of items, each of which can dynamically
/// change size based on the chosen layout.
///
/// Material Design 3 introduced 4 carousel layouts:
///  * Multi-browse: This layout shows at least one large, medium, and small
///    carousel item at a time. This layout is supported by [CarouselView.weighted].
///  * Uncontained (default): This layout show items that scroll to the edge of the
///    container. This layout is supported by [CarouselView].
///  * Hero: This layout shows at least one large and one small item at a time.
///    This layout is supported by [CarouselView.weighted].
///  * Full-screen: This layout shows one edge-to-edge large item at a time and
///    scrolls vertically. The full-screen layout can be supported by both
///    constructors.
///
/// The default constructor implements the uncontained layout model. It shows
/// items that scroll to the edge of the container, behaving similarly to a
/// [ListView] where all children are a uniform size. [CarouselView.weighted]
/// enables dynamic item sizing. Each item is assigned a weight that determines
/// the portion of the viewport it occupies. This constructor helps to create
/// layouts like multi-browse, and hero. In order to have a full-screen layout,
/// if [CarouselView] is used, then set the [itemExtent] to screen size; if
/// [CarouselView.weighted] is used, then set the [flexWeights] to only have
/// one integer in the array.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// This code snippet shows how to get a vertical full-screen carousel by using
/// [itemExtent] in [CarouselView].
///
/// ```dart
/// Scaffold(
///   body: CarouselView(
///     scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
///     itemExtent: double.infinity,
///     children: List<Widget>.generate(10, (int index) {
///       return Center(child: Text('Item $index'));
///     }),
///   ),
/// ),
/// ```
///
/// This code snippet below shows how to achieve the same vertical full-screen
/// carousel by using [flexWeights] in [CarouselView.weighted].
///
/// ```dart
/// Scaffold(
///   body: CarouselView.weighted(
///     scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
///     flexWeights: const <int>[1], // Or any positive integers as long as the length of the array is 1.
///     children: List<Widget>.generate(10, (int index) {
///       return Center(child: Text('Item $index'));
///     }),
///   ),
/// ),
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// In [CarouselView.weighted], weights are relative proportions. For example,
/// if the layout weights is `[3, 2, 1]`, it means the first visible item occupies
/// 3/6 of the viewport; the second visible item occupies 2/6 of the viewport;
/// the last visible item occupies 1/6 of the viewport. As the carousel scrolls,
/// the size of the latter one gradually changes to the size of the former one.
/// As a result, when the first visible item is completely off-screen, the
/// following items will follow the same layout as before. Using [CarouselView.weighted]
/// helps build the multi-browse, hero, center-aligned hero and full-screen layouts,
/// as indicated in [Carousel sepcs](https://m3.material.io/components/carousel/specs).
///
/// The [CarouselController] is used to control the
/// [CarouselController.initialItem], which determines the first fully expanded
/// item when the [CarouselView] or [CarouselView.weighted] is initially displayed.
/// This is straightforward for [CarouselView] because each item in the view
/// has fixed size. In [CarouselView.weighted], for instance, if the layout
/// weights are `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` and the initial item is 4 (the fourth item), the
/// view will display items 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 with weights 1, 2, 3, 2 and 1
/// respectively.
///
/// The [CarouselView.itemExtent] property must be non-null and defines the base
/// size of items. While items typically maintain this size, the first and last
/// visible items may be slightly compressed during scrolling. The [shrinkExtent]
/// property controls the minimum allowable size for these compressed items.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// Here is an example to show different carousel layouts that [CarouselView]
/// and [CarouselView.weighted] can build.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/carousel/carousel.0.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [CarouselController], which controls the first fully visible item in the
///    view.
///  * [PageView], which is a scrollable list that works page by page.

  /// determined by the provided [flexWeights].
  ///
  /// The [flexWeights] parameter is required and defines the relative size
  /// proportions of each child widget.
  ///
  /// While scrolling, the main-axis extent (size) of each visible item changes
  /// dynamically based on the scrolling progress. The cross-axis extent is determined
  /// by the parent constraints. As the first visible item scrolls completely
  /// off-screen, the next item becomes the first visible item, and has the same
  /// size as the previously first item. The rest of the visible items maintain
  /// their relative layout.
  ///
  /// For example, if the layout weights are `[1, 6, 1]`, the length of [flexWeights]
  /// indicates three items will be visible at a time. The layout of these items
  /// would be:
  ///  * First item: Extent is (1 / (1 + 6 + 1)) * viewport extent.
  ///  * Second item: Extent is (6 / (1 + 6 + 1)) * viewport extent.
  ///  * Third item: Extent is (1 / (1 + 6 + 1)) * viewport extent.
  ///
  /// Assuming a viewport extent of 800 in the main axis and the first item is
  /// item 0, there would be three visible items with extents of 100, 600, and 100.
  /// As item 0 scrolls off-screen, the extent of item 1 smoothly decreases from 600
  /// to 100. For instance, if item 0 is 30% off-screen, item 1 should have decreased
  /// its size to 30% of the difference from 600 to 100; its extent would be
  /// 600 - 0.3 * (600 - 100). Similarly, item 2's extent would increase from 100
  /// to 600, becoming 100 + 0.3 * (600 - 100).
  ///
  /// As the initially visible items change size during scrolling, item 3 enters
  /// the view to fill the remaining space. Its extent starts at a minimum of
  /// [shrinkExtent] (or 0 if [shrinkExtent] is not provided) and gradually
  /// increases to match the extent of the last visible item (100 in this example).
  ///
  /// When [consumeMaxWeight] is set to `true`, each child can be expanded to occupy
  /// the maximum weight while scrolling. For example, with [flexWeights] of `[1, 7, 1]`,
  /// the initial weight of the first item is 1. However, by enabling
  /// [consumeMaxWeight] and scrolling forward, the first item can expand to occupy
  /// a weight of 7, leaving a weight of 1 as some empty space before it. This feature
  /// is particularly useful for achieving [Hero](https://m3.material.io/components/carousel/specs#b33a5579-d648-42a9-b934-98718d65454f)
