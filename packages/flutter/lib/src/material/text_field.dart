/// A material design text field.
///
/// A text field lets the user enter text, either with hardware keyboard or with
/// an onscreen keyboard.
///
/// The text field calls the [onChanged] callback whenever the user changes the
/// text in the field. If the user indicates that they are done typing in the
/// field (e.g., by pressing a button on the soft keyboard), the text field
/// calls the [onSubmitted] callback.
///
/// To control the text that is displayed in the text field, use the
/// [controller]. For example, to set the initial value of the text field, use
/// a [controller] that already contains some text. The [controller] can also
/// control the selection and composing region (and to observe changes to the
/// text, selection, and composing region).
///
/// By default, a text field has a [decoration] that draws a divider below the
/// text field. You can use the [decoration] property to control the decoration,
/// for example by adding a label or an icon. If you set the [decoration]
/// property to null, the decoration will be removed entirely, including the
/// extra padding introduced by the decoration to save space for the labels.
///
/// If [decoration] is non-null (which is the default), the text field requires
/// one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget. When the [TextField] is
/// tapped an ink splash that paints on the material is triggered, see
/// [ThemeData.splashFactory].
///
/// To integrate the [TextField] into a [Form] with other [FormField] widgets,
/// consider using [TextFormField].
///

///
///  * <https://material.io/design/components/text-fields.html>
///  * [TextFormField], which integrates with the [Form] widget.
///  * [InputDecorator], which shows the labels and other visual elements that
///    surround the actual text editing widget.
///  * [EditableText], which is the raw text editing control at the heart of a

///    you are implementing an entirely different design language, such as
///    Cupertino.

  /// count two characters, and the second case will be counted as one
  /// character, even though the user can see no difference in the input.
  ///
  /// Similarly, some emoji are represented by multiple scalar values. The
  /// Unicode "THUMBS UP SIGN + MEDIUM SKIN TONE MODIFIER", "👍🏽", should be
  /// counted as a single character, but because it is a combination of two
  /// Unicode scalar values, '\u{1F44D}\u{1F3FD}', it is counted as two
