/// Defines a single color as well a color swatch with ten shades of the color.
///
/// The color's shades are referred to by index. The greater the index, the
/// darker the color. There are 10 valid indices: 50, 100, 200, ..., 900.
/// The value of this color should the same the value of index 500 and [shade500].
///
/// ## Updating to [ColorScheme]
///
/// The [ColorScheme] is preferred for
/// representing colors in applications that are configured
/// for Material 3 (see [ThemeData.useMaterial3]).
/// For more information on colors in Material 3 see
/// the spec at <https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system>.
///
///{@template flutter.material.colors.colorRoles}
/// In Material 3, colors are represented using color roles and
/// corresponding tokens. Each property in the [ColorScheme] class
/// represents one color role as defined in the spec above.
/// {@endtemplate}
///
/// ### Material 3 Colors in Flutter
///
///{@template flutter.material.colors.settingColors}
/// Flutter's Material widgets can be assigned colors at the widget level
/// using widget properties,
/// or at the app level using theme classes.
///
/// For example, you can set the background of the [AppBar] by
/// setting the [AppBar.backgroundColor] to a specific [Color] value.
///
/// To globally set the AppBar background color for your app, you
/// can set the [ThemeData.appBarTheme] property for your [MaterialApp]
/// using the [ThemeData] class. You can also override
/// the default appearance of all the [AppBar]s in a widget subtree by
/// placing the [AppBarTheme] at the root of the subtree.
///
/// Alternatively, you can set the [ThemeData.colorScheme] property
/// to a custom [ColorScheme]. This creates a unified [ColorScheme] to be
/// used across the app. The [AppBar.backgroundColor] uses the
/// [ColorScheme.surface] by default.
///{@endtemplate}
///
/// ### Migrating from [MaterialColor] to [ColorScheme]
///
/// In most cases, there are new properties in Flutter widgets that
/// accept a [ColorScheme] instead of a [MaterialColor].
///
/// For example, you may have previously constructed a [ThemeData]
/// using a primarySwatch:
///
/// ```dart
/// ThemeData(
///   primarySwatch: Colors.amber,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// In Material 3, you can use the [ColorScheme] class to
/// construct a [ThemeData] with the same color palette
/// by using the [ColorScheme.fromSeed] constructor:
///
///  ```dart
/// ThemeData(
///   colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.amber),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// The [ColorScheme.fromSeed] constructor
/// will generate a set of tonal palettes,
/// which are used to create the color scheme.
///
/// Alternatively you can use the [ColorScheme.fromSwatch] constructor:
///
/// ```dart
/// ThemeData(
///  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch(primarySwatch: Colors.amber),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// The [ColorScheme.fromSwatch] constructor will
/// create the color scheme directly from the specific
/// color values used in the [MaterialColor].
///
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Colors], which defines all of the standard material colors.
class MaterialColor extends ColorSwatch<int> {
  /// Creates a color swatch with a variety of shades.
  ///
  /// The `primary` argument should be the 32 bit ARGB value of one of the
  /// values in the swatch, as would be passed to the [Color.new] constructor
  /// for that same color, and as is exposed by [value]. (This is distinct from
  /// the specific index of the color in the swatch.)

/// Instead of using an absolute color from these palettes, consider using
/// [Theme.of] to obtain the local [ThemeData.colorScheme], which defines
/// the colors that most of the Material components use by default.
///
///
/// Most swatches have colors from 100 to 900 in increments of one hundred, plus
/// the color 50. The smaller the number, the more pale the color. The greater
/// the number, the darker the color. The accent swatches (e.g. [redAccent]) only
/// have the values 100, 200, 400, and 700.
///
/// In addition, a series of blacks and whites with common opacities are
/// available. For example, [black54] is a pure black with 54% opacity.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// To select a specific color from one of the swatches, index into the swatch

/// ```dart
/// Color selection = Colors.green[400]!; // Selects a mid-range green.
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// Each [ColorSwatch] constant is a color and can used directly. For example:
