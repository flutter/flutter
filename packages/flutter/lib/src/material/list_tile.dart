/// A list tile contains one to three lines of text optionally flanked by icons or
/// other widgets, such as check boxes. The icons (or other widgets) for the
/// tile are defined with the [leading] and [trailing] parameters. The first
/// line of text is not optional and is specified with [title]. The value of
/// [subtitle], which _is_ optional, will occupy the space allocated for an
/// additional line of text, or two lines if [isThreeLine] is true. If [dense]
/// is true then the overall height of this tile and the size of the
/// [DefaultTextStyle]s that wrap the [title] and [subtitle] widget are reduced.
///
/// It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that [title] does not wrap,
/// and to ensure that [subtitle] doesn't wrap (if [isThreeLine] is false) or
/// wraps to two lines (if it is true).
///
/// The heights of the [leading] and [trailing] widgets are constrained
/// according to the
/// [Material spec](https://material.io/design/components/lists.html).
/// An exception is made for one-line ListTiles for accessibility. Please

/// accessibility requirements.
///
/// The [leading] and [trailing] widgets can expand as far as they wish
/// horizontally, so ensure that they are properly constrained.

/// The [tileColor], [selectedTileColor], [focusColor], and [hoverColor]
/// are not painted by the [ListTile] itself but by the [Material] widget
/// ancestor. In this case, one can wrap a [Material] widget around the
/// [ListTile], e.g.:
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// ```dart
/// const ColoredBox(
///   color: Colors.green,
///   child: Material(
///     child: ListTile(
///       title: Text('ListTile with red background'),
///       tileColor: Colors.red,
///     ),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## Performance considerations when wrapping [ListTile] with [Material]
///
/// Wrapping a large number of [ListTile]s individually with [Material]s
/// is expensive. Consider only wrapping the [ListTile]s that require it
/// or include a common [Material] ancestor where possible.
///
/// [ListTile] must be wrapped in a [Material] widget to animate [tileColor],
/// [selectedTileColor], [focusColor], and [hoverColor] as these colors
/// are not drawn by the list tile itself but by the material widget ancestor.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example showcases how [ListTile] needs to be wrapped in a [Material]
/// widget to animate colors.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/list_tile/list_tile.0.dart **

/// {@tool snippet}
/// To use a [ListTile] within a [Row], it needs to be wrapped in an
/// [Expanded] widget. [ListTile] requires fixed width constraints,
/// whereas a [Row] does not constrain its children.
///
/// ```dart
/// const Row(
///   children: <Widget>[
///     Expanded(
///       child: ListTile(
///         leading: FlutterLogo(),
///         title: Text('These ListTiles are expanded '),
///       ),
///     ),
///     Expanded(
///       child: ListTile(
///         trailing: FlutterLogo(),
///         title: Text('to fill the available space.'),
///       ),
///     ),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// Tiles can be much more elaborate. Here is a tile which can be tapped, but
/// which is disabled when the `_act` variable is not 2. When the tile is
/// tapped, the whole row has an ink splash effect (see [InkWell]).
///
/// ```dart
/// ListTile(
///   leading: const Icon(Icons.flight_land),
///   title: const Text("Trix's airplane"),
///   subtitle: _act != 2 ? const Text('The airplane is only in Act II.') : null,
///   enabled: _act == 2,
///   onTap: () { /* react to the tile being tapped */ }
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// To be accessible, tappable [leading] and [trailing] widgets have to
/// be at least 48x48 in size. However, to adhere to the Material spec,
/// [trailing] and [leading] widgets in one-line ListTiles should visually be
/// at most 32 ([dense]: true) or 40 ([dense]: false) in height, which may
/// conflict with the accessibility requirement.
///
/// For this reason, a one-line ListTile allows the height of [leading]
/// and [trailing] widgets to be constrained by the height of the ListTile.
/// This allows for the creation of tappable [leading] and [trailing] widgets
/// that are large enough, but it is up to the developer to ensure that
/// their widgets follow the Material spec.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// Here is an example of a one-line, non-[dense] ListTile with a
/// tappable leading widget that adheres to accessibility requirements and
/// the Material spec. To adjust the use case below for a one-line, [dense]
/// ListTile, adjust the vertical padding to 8.0.
///
/// ```dart
/// ListTile(
///   leading: GestureDetector(
///     behavior: HitTestBehavior.translucent,
///     onTap: () {},
///     child: Container(
///       width: 48,
///       height: 48,
///       padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 4.0),
///       alignment: Alignment.center,
///       child: const CircleAvatar(),
///     ),
///   ),
///   title: const Text('title'),
///   dense: false,
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## The ListTile layout isn't exactly what I want
///
/// If the way ListTile pads and positions its elements isn't quite what
/// you're looking for, it's easy to create custom list items with a
/// combination of other widgets, such as [Row]s and [Column]s.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
