/// Shows a full screen search page and returns the search result selected by
/// the user when the page is closed.
///
/// The search page consists of an app bar with a search field and a body which
/// can either show suggested search queries or the search results.
///
/// The appearance of the search page is determined by the provided
/// `delegate`. The initial query string is given by `query`, which defaults
/// to the empty string. When `query` is set to null, `delegate.query` will
/// be used as the initial query.
///
/// This method returns the selected search result, which can be set in the
/// [SearchDelegate.close] call. If the search page is closed with the system
/// back button, it returns null.
///
/// A given [SearchDelegate] can only be associated with one active [showSearch]
/// call. Call [SearchDelegate.close] before re-using the same delegate instance
/// for another [showSearch] call.
///
/// The `useRootNavigator` argument is used to determine whether to push the
/// search page to the [Navigator] furthest from or nearest to the given
/// `context`. By default, `useRootNavigator` is `false` and the search page
/// route created by this method is pushed to the nearest navigator to the
/// given `context`. It can not be `null`.
///
/// The transition to the search page triggered by this method looks best if the
/// screen triggering the transition contains an [AppBar] at the top and the
/// transition is called from an [IconButton] that's part of [AppBar.actions].
/// The animation provided by [SearchDelegate.transitionAnimation] can be used
/// to trigger additional animations in the underlying page while the search
/// page fades in or out. This is commonly used to animate an [AnimatedIcon] in
/// the [AppBar.leading] position e.g. from the hamburger menu to the back arrow
/// used to exit the search page.
