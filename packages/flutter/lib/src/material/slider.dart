/// A slider can be used to select from either a continuous or a discrete set of
/// values. The default is to use a continuous range of values from [min] to
/// [max]. To use discrete values, use a non-null value for [divisions], which
/// indicates the number of discrete intervals. For example, if [min] is 0.0 and
/// [max] is 50.0 and [divisions] is 5, then the slider can take on the
/// discrete values 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, and 50.0.
///
/// The terms for the parts of a slider are:
///
///  * The "thumb", which is a shape that slides horizontally when the user
///    drags it.
///  * The "track", which is the line that the slider thumb slides along.
///  * The "value indicator", which is a shape that pops up when the user
///    is dragging the thumb to indicate the value being selected.
///  * The "active" side of the slider is the side between the thumb and the
///    minimum value.
///  * The "inactive" side of the slider is the side between the thumb and the
///    maximum value.
///
/// The slider will be disabled if [onChanged] is null or if the range given by
/// [min]..[max] is empty (i.e. if [min] is equal to [max]).
///
/// The slider widget itself does not maintain any state. Instead, when the state
/// of the slider changes, the widget calls the [onChanged] callback. Most
/// widgets that use a slider will listen for the [onChanged] callback and
/// rebuild the slider with a new [value] to update the visual appearance of the
/// slider. To know when the value starts to change, or when it is done
/// changing, set the optional callbacks [onChangeStart] and/or [onChangeEnd].
///
/// By default, a slider will be as wide as possible, centered vertically. When
/// given unbounded constraints, it will attempt to make the track 144 pixels
/// wide (with margins on each side) and will shrink-wrap vertically.
///
/// Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
///
/// Requires one of its ancestors to be a [MediaQuery] widget. Typically, these
/// are introduced by the [MaterialApp] or [WidgetsApp] widget at the top of
/// your application widget tree.
///
/// To determine how it should be displayed (e.g. colors, thumb shape, etc.),
/// a slider uses the [SliderThemeData] available from either a [SliderTheme]
/// widget or the [ThemeData.sliderTheme] a [Theme] widget above it in the
/// widget tree. You can also override some of the colors with the [activeColor]
/// and [inactiveColor] properties, although more fine-grained control of the
/// look is achieved using a [SliderThemeData].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [SliderTheme] and [SliderThemeData] for information about controlling
///    the visual appearance of the slider.
