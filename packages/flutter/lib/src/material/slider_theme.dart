/// The parts of a slider are:
///
///  * The "thumb", which is a shape that slides horizontally when the user
///    drags it.
///  * The "track", which is the line that the slider thumb slides along.
///  * The "tick marks", which are regularly spaced marks that are drawn when
///    using discrete divisions.
///  * The "value indicator", which appears when the user is dragging the thumb
///    to indicate the value being selected.
///  * The "overlay", which appears around the thumb, and is shown when the
///    thumb is pressed, focused, or hovered. It is painted underneath the
///    thumb, so it must extend beyond the bounds of the thumb itself to
///    actually be visible.
///  * The "active" side of the slider is the side between the thumb and the
///    minimum value.
///  * The "inactive" side of the slider is the side between the thumb and the
///    maximum value.
///  * The [Slider] is disabled when it is not accepting user input. See
///    [Slider] for details on when this happens.
///
/// The thumb, track, tick marks, value indicator, and overlay can be customized
/// by creating subclasses of [SliderTrackShape],
/// [SliderComponentShape], and/or [SliderTickMarkShape]. See
/// [RoundSliderThumbShape], [RectangularSliderTrackShape],
/// [RoundSliderTickMarkShape], [RectangularSliderValueIndicatorShape], and
/// [RoundSliderOverlayShape] for examples.
///
/// The track painting can be skipped by specifying 0 for [trackHeight].
/// The thumb painting can be skipped by specifying
/// [SliderComponentShape.noThumb] for [SliderThemeData.thumbShape].
/// The overlay painting can be skipped by specifying
/// [SliderComponentShape.noOverlay] for [SliderThemeData.overlayShape].
/// The tick mark painting can be skipped by specifying
/// [SliderTickMarkShape.noTickMark] for [SliderThemeData.tickMarkShape].

/// appropriate [ShowValueIndicator] for [SliderThemeData.showValueIndicator].
