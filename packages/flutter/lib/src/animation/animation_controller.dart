/// Configures how an [AnimationController] behaves when animations are
/// disabled.
///
/// When [AccessibilityFeatures.disableAnimations] is true, the device is asking
/// Flutter to reduce or disable animations as much as possible. To honor this,
/// we reduce the duration and the corresponding number of frames for
/// animations. This enum is used to allow certain [AnimationController]s to opt
/// out of this behavior.
///
/// For example, the [AnimationController] which controls the physics simulation
/// for a scrollable list will have [AnimationBehavior.preserve], so that when
/// a user attempts to scroll it does not jump to the end/beginning too quickly.

  ///

  /// flashing rapidly on the screen if the widget does not take the
  /// [AccessibilityFeatures.disableAnimations] flag into account.
  preserve,
}

/// A controller for an animation.
///
/// This class lets you perform tasks such as:
///
/// * Play an animation [forward] or in [reverse], or [stop] an animation.
/// * Set the animation to a specific [value].
/// * Define the [upperBound] and [lowerBound] values of an animation.
/// * Create a [fling] animation effect using a physics simulation.
///
/// By default, an [AnimationController] linearly produces values that range
/// from 0.0 to 1.0, during a given duration.
///
/// When the animation is actively animating, the animation controller generates
/// a new value each time the device running your app is ready to display a new
/// frame (typically, this rate is around 60–120 values per second).
/// If the animation controller is associated with a [State]
/// through a [TickerProvider], then its updates will be silenced when that
/// [State]'s subtree is disabled as defined by [TickerMode]; time will still
/// elapse, and methods like [forward] and [stop] can still be called and
/// will change the value, but the controller will not generate new values
/// on its own.
///
/// ## Ticker providers
///
/// An [AnimationController] needs a [TickerProvider], which is configured using
/// the `vsync` argument on the constructor.
/// The constructor uses the [TickerProvider] to create a [Ticker], which
/// the [AnimationController] uses to step through the animation it controls.
///
/// For advice on obtaining a ticker provider, see [TickerProvider].
/// Typically the relevant [State] serves as the ticker provider,
/// after applying a suitable mixin (like [SingleTickerProviderStateMixin])
/// to cause the [State] subclass to implement [TickerProvider].
///
/// ## Life cycle
///
/// An [AnimationController] should be [dispose]d when it is no longer needed.
/// This reduces the likelihood of leaks. When used with a [StatefulWidget], it
/// is common for an [AnimationController] to be created in the
/// [State.initState] method and then disposed in the [State.dispose] method.
///
/// ## Using [Future]s with [AnimationController]
///
/// The methods that start animations return a [TickerFuture] object which
/// completes when the animation completes successfully, and never throws an
/// error; if the animation is canceled, the future never completes. This object
/// also has a [TickerFuture.orCancel] property which returns a future that
/// completes when the animation completes successfully, and completes with an
/// error when the animation is aborted.
///
/// This can be used to write code such as the `fadeOutAndUpdateState` method
/// below.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// Here is a stateful `Foo` widget. Its [State] uses the
/// [SingleTickerProviderStateMixin] to implement the necessary
/// [TickerProvider], creating its controller in the [State.initState] method
/// and disposing of it in the [State.dispose] method. The duration of the
/// controller is configured from a property in the `Foo` widget; as that
/// changes, the [State.didUpdateWidget] method is used to update the
/// controller.
///
/// ```dart
/// class Foo extends StatefulWidget {
///   const Foo({ super.key, required this.duration });
///
///   final Duration duration;
///
///   @override
///   State<Foo> createState() => _FooState();
/// }
///
/// class _FooState extends State<Foo> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
///   late AnimationController _controller;
///
///   @override
///   void initState() {
///     super.initState();
///     _controller = AnimationController(
///       vsync: this, // the SingleTickerProviderStateMixin
///       duration: widget.duration,
///     );
///   }
///
///   @override
///   void didUpdateWidget(Foo oldWidget) {
///     super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
///     _controller.duration = widget.duration;
///   }
///
///   @override
///   void dispose() {
///     _controller.dispose();
///     super.dispose();
///   }
///
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     return Container(); // ...
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// The following method (for a [State] subclass) drives two animation
/// controllers using Dart's asynchronous syntax for awaiting [Future] objects:
///
/// ```dart
/// Future<void> fadeOutAndUpdateState() async {
///   try {
///     await fadeAnimationController.forward().orCancel;
///     await sizeAnimationController.forward().orCancel;
///     setState(() {
///       dismissed = true;
///     });
///   } on TickerCanceled {
///     // the animation got canceled, probably because we were disposed
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// The assumption in the code above is that the animation controllers are being
/// disposed in the [State] subclass' override of the [State.dispose] method.
/// Since disposing the controller cancels the animation (raising a
/// [TickerCanceled] exception), the code here can skip verifying whether
/// [State.mounted] is still true at each step. (Again, this assumes that the
/// controllers are created in [State.initState] and disposed in
/// [State.dispose], as described in the previous section.)
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example shows how to use [AnimationController] and
/// [SlideTransition] to create an animated digit like you might find
/// on an old pinball machine our your car's odometer.  New digit
/// values slide into place from below, as the old value slides
/// upwards and out of view. Taps that occur while the controller is
/// already animating cause the controller's
/// [AnimationController.duration] to be reduced so that the visuals
/// don't fall behind.
///
