/// ### [MaxLengthEnforcement.enforced] versus
/// [MaxLengthEnforcement.truncateAfterCompositionEnds]
///
/// Both [MaxLengthEnforcement.enforced] and
/// [MaxLengthEnforcement.truncateAfterCompositionEnds] make sure the final
/// length of the text does not exceed the max length specified. The difference
/// is that [MaxLengthEnforcement.enforced] truncates all text while
/// [MaxLengthEnforcement.truncateAfterCompositionEnds] allows composing text to
/// exceed the limit. Allowing this "placeholder" composing text to exceed the
/// limit may provide a better user experience on some platforms for entering
/// ideographic characters (e.g. CJK characters) via composing on phonetic
/// keyboards.
///
/// Some input methods (Gboard on Android for example) initiate text composition
/// even for Latin characters, in which case the best experience may be to
/// truncate those composing characters with [MaxLengthEnforcement.enforced].
///
/// In fields that strictly support only a small subset of characters, such as
/// verification code fields, [MaxLengthEnforcement.enforced] may provide the
/// best experience.
/// {@endtemplate}
///
/// See also:

///    [TextField.maxLength] to limit the length of user input. [TextField] also
///    provides a character counter to provide visual feedback.

  /// which is the letter "o" followed by a composed diaeresis "¨", or it can
  /// be represented as '\u{00F6}', which is the Unicode scalar value "LATIN
  /// SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS". It will be counted as a single character
