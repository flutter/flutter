/// A class with static values that describe the keys that are returned from
/// [RawKeyEvent.logicalKey].
///
/// These represent *logical* keys, which are keys which are interpreted in the
/// context of any modifiers, modes, or keyboard layouts which may be in effect.
///
/// This is contrast to [PhysicalKeyboardKey], which represents a physical key
/// in a particular location on the keyboard, without regard for the modifier
/// state, mode, or keyboard layout.
///
/// As an example, if you wanted to implement an app where the "Q" key "quit"
/// something, you'd want to look at the logical key to detect this, since you
/// would like to have it match the key with "Q" on it, instead of always
/// looking for "the key next next to the TAB key", since on a French keyboard,
/// the key next to the TAB key has an "A" on it.
///
/// Conversely, if you wanted a game where the key next to the CAPS LOCK (the
/// "A" key on a QWERTY keyboard) moved the player to the left, you'd want to
/// look at the physical key to make sure that regardless of the character the
/// key produces, you got the key that is in that location on the keyboard.
///
/// {@tool dartpad --template=stateful_widget_scaffold}
/// This example shows how to detect if the user has selected the logical "Q"
/// key.

/// A class with static values that describe the keys that are returned from

///
/// These represent *physical* keys, which are keys which represent a particular
/// key location on a QWERTY keyboard. It ignores any modifiers, modes, or
/// keyboard layouts which may be in effect. This is contrast to
/// [LogicalKeyboardKey], which represents a logical key interpreted in the
/// context of modifiers, modes, and/or keyboard layouts.
///
/// As an example, if you wanted a game where the key next to the CAPS LOCK (the
/// "A" key on a QWERTY keyboard) moved the player to the left, you'd want to
/// look at the physical key to make sure that regardless of the character the
/// key produces, you got the key that is in that location on the keyboard.
///
/// Conversely, if you wanted to implement an app where the "Q" key "quit"
/// something, you'd want to look at the logical key to detect this, since you
/// would like to have it match the key with "Q" on it, instead of always
/// looking for "the key next next to the TAB key", since on a French keyboard,
/// the key next to the TAB key has an "A" on it.
