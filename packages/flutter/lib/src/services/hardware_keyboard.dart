  /// [PhysicalKeyboardKey]s are used to describe and test for keys in a
  /// particular location. A [PhysicalKeyboardKey] may have a name, but the name
  /// is for convenience only ("keyA" is easier to remember than 0x70004),
  /// derived from the key's effect on a QWERTY keyboard. The name does not
  /// represent the key's effect whatsoever (a physical "keyA" is actually the Q
  /// key on an AZERTY keyboard.)
  ///
  /// For instance, if you wanted to make a game where the key to the right of
  /// the CAPS LOCK key made the player move left, you would be comparing a
  /// physical key with [PhysicalKeyboardKey.keyA], since that is the key next to
  /// the CAPS LOCK key on a QWERTY keyboard. This would return the same thing
  /// even on an AZERTY keyboard where the key next to the CAPS LOCK produces a
  /// "Q" when pressed.

  /// on it regardless of location of the key, use [KeyEvent.logicalKey] instead.
