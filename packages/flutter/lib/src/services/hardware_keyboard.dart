/// key, respectively. For [KeyDownEvent]s, the character produced by the event
/// (if any) is also included.

/// See also:
///
///  * [LogicalKeyboardKey], an object that describes the logical meaning of a
///    key.
///  * [PhysicalKeyboardKey], an object that describes the physical location of
///    a key.
///  * [KeyDownEvent], a subclass for events representing the user
///    pressing a key.
///  * [KeyUpEvent], a subclass for events representing the user
///    releasing a key.
///  * [KeySyncEvent], a subclass for events representing the user

  /// return the same thing even on a French keyboard where the key next to the
  /// CAPS LOCK produces a "Q" when pressed.
