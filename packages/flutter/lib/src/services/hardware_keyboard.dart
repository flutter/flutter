///
/// To stay notified whenever keys are pressed, held, or released, add a
/// handler with [addHandler]. To only be notified when a specific part of the
/// app is focused, use a [Focus] widget's `onFocusChanged` attribute instead
/// of [addHandler]. Handlers should be removed with [removeHandler] when
/// notification is no longer necessary, or when the handler is being disposed.
///
/// To query whether a key is being held, or a lock mode is enabled, use
/// [physicalKeysPressed], [logicalKeysPressed], or [lockModesEnabled].
/// These states will have been updated with the event when used during a key

/// ## Event model
///
/// Flutter uses a universal event model ([KeyEvent]) and key options
/// ([LogicalKeyboardKey] and [PhysicalKeyboardKey]) regardless of the native
/// platform, while preserving platform-specific features as much as
/// possible.
///
/// [HardwareKeyboard] guarantees that the key model is "regularized": The key
/// event stream consists of "key tap sequences", where a key tap sequence is
/// defined as one [KeyDownEvent], zero or more [KeyRepeatEvent]s, and one
/// [KeyUpEvent] in order, all with the same physical key and logical key.
///
/// Example:
///
///  * Tap and hold key A, US layout:
///     * KeyDownEvent(physicalKey: keyA, logicalKey: keyA, character: "a")
///     * KeyRepeatEvent(physicalKey: keyA, logicalKey: keyA, character: "a")
///     * KeyUpEvent(physicalKey: keyA, logicalKey: keyA)
///  * Press ShiftLeft, tap key A, then release ShiftLeft, US layout:
///     * KeyDownEvent(physicalKey: shiftLeft, logicalKey: shiftLeft)
///     * KeyDownEvent(physicalKey: keyA, logicalKey: keyA, character: "A")
///     * KeyRepeatEvent(physicalKey: keyA, logicalKey: keyA, character: "A")
///     * KeyUpEvent(physicalKey: keyA, logicalKey: keyA)
///     * KeyUpEvent(physicalKey: shiftLeft, logicalKey: shiftLeft)
///  * Tap key Q, French layout:
///     * KeyDownEvent(physicalKey: keyA, logicalKey: keyQ, character: "q")
///     * KeyUpEvent(physicalKey: keyA, logicalKey: keyQ)
///  * Tap CapsLock:
///     * KeyDownEvent(physicalKey: capsLock, logicalKey: capsLock)
///     * KeyUpEvent(physicalKey: capsLock, logicalKey: capsLock)
///
/// When the Flutter application starts, all keys are released, and all lock
/// modes are disabled. Upon key events, [HardwareKeyboard] will update its
/// states, then dispatch callbacks: [KeyDownEvent]s and [KeyUpEvent]s set
/// or reset the pressing state, while [KeyDownEvent]s also toggle lock modes.
///
/// Flutter will try to synchronize with the ground truth of keyboard states
/// using synthesized events ([KeyEvent.synthesized]), subject to the
/// availability of the platform. The desynchronization can be caused by
/// non-empty initial state or a change in the focused window or application.
/// For example, if CapsLock is enabled when the application starts, then
/// immediately before the first key event, a synthesized [KeyDownEvent] and
/// [KeyUpEvent] of CapsLock will be dispatched.
///
/// The resulting event stream does not map one-to-one to the native key event
/// stream. Some native events might be skipped, while some events might be
/// synthesized and do not correspond to native events. Synthesized events will
/// be indicated by [KeyEvent.synthesized].
///
/// Example:
///
///  * Flutter starts with CapsLock on, the first press of keyA:
///     * KeyDownEvent(physicalKey: capsLock, logicalKey: capsLock, synthesized: true)
///     * KeyUpEvent(physicalKey: capsLock, logicalKey: capsLock, synthesized: true)
///     * KeyDownEvent(physicalKey: keyA, logicalKey: keyA, character: "a")
///  * While holding ShiftLeft, lose window focus, release shiftLeft, then focus
///    back and press keyA:
///     * KeyUpEvent(physicalKey: shiftLeft, logicalKey: shiftLeft, synthesized: true)
///     * KeyDownEvent(physicalKey: keyA, logicalKey: keyA, character: "a")
///
/// Flutter does not distinguish between multiple keyboards. Flutter will
/// process all events as if they come from a single keyboard, and try to
/// resolve any conflicts and provide a regularized key event stream, which
/// can deviate from the ground truth.
///

///    describe specific key events.

///
/// ## On embedder implementation
///
/// Currently, Flutter has two sets of key event API pathways running in
/// parallel.
///
/// * The "hardware key event" pathway receives messages from the
///   "flutter/keydata" message channel (embedder API
///   `FlutterEngineSendKeyEvent`) and dispatches [KeyEvent] to
///   [HardwareKeyboard] and some methods such as [Focus.onKeyEvent].
/// * The deprecated "raw key event" pathway receives messages from the
///   "flutter/keyevent" message channel ([SystemChannels.keyEvent]) and
///   dispatches [RawKeyEvent] to [RawKeyboard] and [Focus.onKey] as well as
///   similar methods. This pathway will be removed at a future date.
///
/// [KeyEventManager] resolves cross-platform compatibility of keyboard
/// implementations, since legacy platforms might have not implemented the new
/// key data API and only send raw key data on each key message.
/// [KeyEventManager] recognizes the platform support by detecting whether a
/// message comes from platform channel "flutter/keyevent" before one from
/// "flutter/keydata", or vice versa, at the beginning of the app.
///
/// * If a "flutter/keydata" message is received first, then this platform is
///   considered a modern platform. The hardware key events are stored, and
///   dispatched only when a raw key message is received.
/// * If a "flutter/keyevent" message is received first, then this platform is
///   considered a legacy platform. The raw key event is transformed into a
///   hardware key event at best effort. No messages from "flutter/keydata" are
///   expected. This behavior has been deprecated, and will be removed at a
///   future date.
///
/// Therefore, to correctly implement a platform that supports
/// `FlutterEngineSendKeyEvent`, the platform must ensure that
/// `FlutterEngineSendKeyEvent` is called before sending a message to
/// "flutter/keyevent" at the beginning of the app, and every physical key event
/// is ended with a "flutter/keyevent" message.

  /// Typical applications use [WidgetsBinding], where this field is set by the

  /// incoming events to the focus system, including `FocusNode.onKey`,
  /// `FocusNode.onKeyEvent`, and `Shortcuts`. In this case, the application
  /// does not need to read, assign, or invoke this value.
  ///
  /// For advanced uses, the application can "patch" this callback. See below
  /// for details.
  ///
  /// ## Handlers and event results
  ///
  /// Roughly speaking, Flutter processes each native key event with the
  /// following phases:
  ///
  /// 1. Platform-side pre-filtering, sometimes used for IME.
  /// 2. The key event system.
  /// 3. The text input system.
  /// 4. Other native components (possibly non-Flutter).
  ///
  /// Each phase will conclude with a boolean called an "event result". If the
  /// result is true, this phase _handles_ the event and prevents the event from
  /// being propagated to the next phase. This mechanism allows shortcuts such
  /// as "Ctrl-C" to not generate a text "C" in the text field, or shortcuts
  /// that are not handled by any components to trigger special alerts (such as
  /// the "bonk" noise on macOS).
  ///
  /// In the second phase, known as "the key event system", the event is
  /// dispatched to several destinations: [RawKeyboard]'s listeners,
  /// [HardwareKeyboard]'s handlers, and [keyMessageHandler]. All destinations
  /// will always receive the event regardless of the handlers' results. If any
  /// handler's result is true, then the overall result of the second phase is
  /// true, and event propagation is stopped.
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  /// * [RawKeyboard.addListener], which adds a raw keyboard listener.
  /// * [RawKeyboardListener], which is also implemented by adding a raw
  ///   keyboard listener.
  /// * [HardwareKeyboard.addHandler], which adds a hardware keyboard handler.
  ///
  /// ## Advanced usages: Manual assignment or patching
  ///
  /// If you are not using the focus system to manage focus, set this attribute
  /// to a [KeyMessageHandler] that returns true if the propagation on the
  /// platform should not be continued. If this field is null, key events will
  /// be assumed to not have been handled by Flutter, a result of "false".
  ///
  /// Even if you are using the focus system, you might also want to do more
  /// than the focus system allows. In these cases, you can _patch_
  /// [keyMessageHandler] by setting it to a callback that performs your tasks
  /// and calls the original callback in between (or not at all.)
  ///
  /// Patching [keyMessageHandler] can not be reverted. You should always assume
  /// that another component might have patched it before you and after you.
  /// This means that you might want to write your own global notification
  /// manager, to which callbacks can be added and removed.
  ///
  /// You should not patch [keyMessageHandler] until the `FocusManager` has
  /// assigned its callback. This is assured during any time within the widget
  /// lifecycle (such as `initState`), or after calling
  /// `WidgetManager.instance`.
  ///
  /// {@tool dartpad}
  /// This example shows how to process key events that are not
  /// handled by any focus handler (such as `Shortcuts`) by patching
  /// [keyMessageHandler].
  ///
  /// The app prints out any key events that are not handled by the app body.
  /// Try typing something in the first text field. These key presses are not
  /// handled by `Shortcuts` and will be sent to the fallback handler and
  /// printed out. Now try some text shortcuts, such as Ctrl+A. The KeyA press
  /// is handled as a shortcut, and is not sent to the fallback handler and so
  /// is not printed out.
  ///
  /// The key widget is `FallbackKeyEventRegistrar`, a necessity class to allow
  /// reversible patching. `FallbackFocus` and `FallbackFocusNode` are also
  /// useful to recognize the widget tree's structure. `FallbackDemo` is an
  /// example of using them in an app.
