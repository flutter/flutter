///
/// A [RawKeyboard] is useful for listening to raw key events and hardware

///
/// Behavior-wise, [RawKeyboard] provides a less unified, less regular event
/// model than [HardwareKeyboard]. For example:
///
/// * Down events might not be matched with an up event, and vice versa (the set
///   of pressed keys is silently updated).
/// * The logical key of the down event might not be the same as that of the up
///   event.
/// * Down events and repeat events are not easily distinguishable (must be
///   tracked manually).
/// * Lock modes (such as CapsLock) only have their "enabled" state recorded.
///   There's no way to acquire their pressing state.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [RawKeyDownEvent] and [RawKeyUpEvent], the classes used to describe
///    specific raw key events.
///  * [RawKeyboardListener], a widget that listens for raw key events.
///  * [SystemChannels.keyEvent], the low-level channel used for receiving events
///    from the system.
