/// virtual keyboard, iOS enters floating cursor mode where the whole keyboard
/// becomes a trackpad. In this mode, there are two visible cursors. One, the
/// floating cursor, hovers over the text, following the user's horizontal

/// where the cursor will go horizontally when the user releases the trackpad.

/// cursor is a faint shadow of the cursor rendered in the text field in the

/// An low-level interface to the system's text input control.

/// and a [TextInputClient]. The majority of commands available for
/// interacting with the text input control reside in the returned
/// [TextInputConnection]. The communication between the system text input and
/// the [TextInputClient] is asynchronous.
///
/// The platform text input plugin (which represents the system's text input)
/// and the [TextInputClient] usually maintain their own text editing states
/// ([TextEditingValue]) separately. They must be kept in sync as long as the
/// [TextInputClient] is connected. The following methods can be used to send
/// [TextEditingValue] to update the other party, when either party's text
/// editing states change:
///
/// * The [TextInput.attach] method allows a [TextInputClient] to establish a
///   connection to the text input. An optional field in its `configuration`
///   parameter can be used to specify an initial value for the platform text
///   input plugin's [TextEditingValue].
///
/// * The [TextInputClient] sends its [TextEditingValue] to the platform text
///   input plugin using [TextInputConnection.setEditingState].
///
/// * The platform text input plugin sends its [TextEditingValue] to the
///   connected [TextInputClient] via a "TextInput.setEditingState" message.
///
/// * When autofill happens on a disconnected [TextInputClient], the platform
///   text input plugin sends the [TextEditingValue] to the connected
///   [TextInputClient]'s [AutofillScope], and the [AutofillScope] will further
///   relay the value to the correct [TextInputClient].
///
/// When synchronizing the [TextEditingValue]s, the communication may get stuck
/// in an infinite when both parties are trying to send their own update. To
/// mitigate the problem, only [TextInputClient]s are allowed to alter the
/// received [TextEditingValue]s while platform text input plugins are to accept
/// the received [TextEditingValue]s unmodified. More specifically:
///
/// * When a [TextInputClient] receives a new [TextEditingValue] from the
///   platform text input plugin, it's allowed to modify the value (for example,
///   apply [TextInputFormatter]s). If it decides to do so, it must send the
///   updated [TextEditingValue] back to the platform text input plugin to keep
///   the [TextEditingValue]s in sync.
///
/// * When the platform text input plugin receives a new value from the
///   connected [TextInputClient], it must accept the new value as-is, to avoid
///   sending back an updated value.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [TextField], a widget in which the user may enter text.
///  * [EditableText], a [TextInputClient] that connects to [TextInput] when it
///    wants to take user input from the keyboard.

  /// {@template flutter.services.TextInput.finishAutofillContext}
  /// An autofill context is a collection of input fields that live in the
  /// platform's text input plugin. The platform is encouraged to save the user
  /// input stored in the current autofill context before the context is
  /// destroyed, when [TextInput.finishAutofillContext] is called with
  /// `shouldSave` set to true.
  ///
  /// Currently, there can only be at most one autofill context at any given
  /// time. When any input field in an [AutofillGroup] requests for autofill
  /// (which is done automatically when an autofillable [EditableText] gains
  /// focus), the current autofill context will merge the content of that
  /// [AutofillGroup] into itself. When there isn't an existing autofill context,
  /// one will be created to hold the newly added input fields from the group.
  ///
  /// Once added to an autofill context, an input field will stay in the context
  /// until the context is destroyed. To prevent leaks, call
  /// [TextInput.finishAutofillContext] to signal the text input plugin that the
  /// user has finalized their input in the current autofill context. The
  /// platform text input plugin either encourages or discourages the platform
  /// from saving the user input based on the value of the `shouldSave`
  /// parameter. The platform usually shows a "Save for autofill?" prompt for
  /// user confirmation.
  /// {@endtemplate}
  ///
  /// On many platforms, calling [finishAutofillContext] shows the save user
  /// input dialog and disrupts the user's flow. Ideally the dialog should only
  /// be shown no more than once for every screen. Consider removing premature
  /// [finishAutofillContext] calls to prevent showing the save user input UI
  /// too frequently. However, calling [finishAutofillContext] when there's no
  /// existing autofill context usually does not bring up the save user input
  /// UI.
