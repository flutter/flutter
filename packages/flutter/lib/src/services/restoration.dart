/// Manages the restoration data in the framework and synchronizes it with the
/// engine.
///
/// Restoration data can be serialized out and - at a later point in time - be
/// used to restore the application to the previous state described by the
/// serialized data. Mobile operating systems use the concept of state
/// restoration to provide the illusion that apps continue to run in the
/// background forever: after an app has been backgrounded, the user can always
/// return to it and find it in the same state. In practice, the operating
/// system may, however, terminate the app to free resources for other apps
/// running in the foreground. Before that happens, the app gets a chance to
/// serialize out its restoration data. When the user navigates back to the
/// backgrounded app, it is restarted and the serialized restoration data is
/// provided to it again. Ideally, the app will use that data to restore itself
/// to the same state it was in when the user backgrounded the app.
///
/// In Flutter, restoration data is organized in a tree of [RestorationBucket]s
/// which is rooted in the [rootBucket]. All information that the application
/// needs to restore its current state must be stored in a bucket in this
/// hierarchy. To store data in the hierarchy, entities (e.g. [Widget]s) must
/// claim ownership of a child bucket from a parent bucket (which may be the
/// [rootBucket] provided by this [RestorationManager]). The owner of a bucket
/// may store arbitrary values in the bucket as long as they can be serialized
/// with the [StandardMessageCodec]. The values are stored in the bucket under a
/// given restoration ID as key. A restoration ID is a [String] that must be
/// unique within a given bucket. To access the stored value again during state
/// restoration, the same restoration ID must be provided again. The owner of
/// the bucket may also make the bucket available to other entities so that they
/// can claim child buckets from it for their own restoration needs. Within a
/// bucket, child buckets are also identified by unique restoration IDs. The
/// restoration ID must be provided when claiming a child bucket.
///
/// When restoration data is provided to the [RestorationManager] (e.g. after
/// the application relaunched when foregrounded again), the bucket hierarchy
/// with all the data stored in it is restored. Entities can retrieve the data
/// again by using the same restoration IDs that they originally used to store
/// the data.
///
/// In addition to providing restoration data when the app is launched,
/// restoration data may also be provided to a running app to restore it to a
/// previous state (e.g. when the user hits the back/forward button in the web
/// browser). When this happens, the [RestorationManager] notifies its listeners
/// (added via [addListener]) that a new [rootBucket] is available. In response
/// to the notification, listeners must stop using the old bucket and restore
/// their state from the information in the new [rootBucket].
///
/// Some platforms restrict the size of the restoration data. Therefore, the
/// data stored in the buckets should be as small as possible while still
/// allowing the app to restore its current state from it. Data that can be
/// retrieved from other services (e.g. a database or a web server) should not
/// be included in the restoration data. Instead, a small identifier (e.g. a
/// UUID, database record number, or resource locator) should be stored that can
/// be used to retrieve the data again from its original source during state
/// restoration.
///
/// The [RestorationManager] sends a serialized version of the bucket hierarchy
/// over to the engine at the end of a frame in which the data in the hierarchy
/// or its shape has changed. The engine caches the data until the operating
/// system needs it. The application is responsible for keeping the data in the
/// bucket always up-to-date to reflect its current state.
///
/// ## Discussion
///
/// Due to Flutter's threading model and restrictions in the APIs of the
/// platforms Flutter runs on, restoration data must be stored in the buckets
/// proactively as described above. When the operating system asks for the
/// restoration data, it will do so on the platform thread expecting a
/// synchronous response. To avoid the risk of deadlocks, the platform thread
/// cannot block and call into the UI thread (where the dart code is running) to
/// retrieve the restoration data. For this reason, the [RestorationManager]
/// always sends the latest copy of the restoration data from the UI thread over
/// to the platform thread whenever it changes. That way, the restoration data
/// is always ready to go on the platform thread when the operating system needs
/// it.
///
/// ## State Restoration on iOS
///
/// To enable state restoration on iOS, a restoration identifier has to be
/// assigned to the [FlutterViewController](https://api.flutter.dev/objcdoc/Classes/FlutterViewController.html).
/// If the standard embedding (produced by `flutter create`) is used, this can
/// be accomplished with the following steps:
///
///  1. In the app's directory, open `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` with Xcode.
///  2. Select `Main.storyboard` under `Runner/Runner` in the Project Navigator
///     on the left.
///  3. Select the `Flutter View Controller` under
///     `Flutter View Controller Scene` in the view hierarchy.
///  4. Navigate to the Identity Inspector in the panel on the right.
///  5. Enter a unique restoration ID in the provided field.
///  6. Save the project.
///
/// ## Development with hot restart and hot reload
///
/// Changes applied to your app with hot reload and hot restart are not
/// persisted on the device. They are lost when the app is fully terminated and
/// restarted, e.g. by the operating system. Therefore, your app may not restore
/// correctly during development if you have made changes and applied them with
/// hot restart or hot reload. To test state restoration, always make sure to
/// fully re-compile your application (e.g. by re-executing `flutter run`) after
/// making a change.
///
/// ## Testing State Restoration
///
/// {@template flutter.widgets.RestorationManager}
/// To test state restoration on Android:
///   1. Turn on "Don't keep activities", which destroys the Android activity
///      as soon as the user leaves it. This option should become available
///      when Developer Options are turned on for the device.
///   2. Run the code sample on an Android device.
///   3. Create some in-memory state in the app on the phone,
///      e.g. by navigating to a different screen.
///   4. Background the Flutter app, then return to it. It will restart
///      and restore its state.
///
/// To test state restoration on iOS:
///   1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace/` in Xcode.
///   2. (iOS 14+ only): Switch to build in profile or release mode, as
///      launching an app from the home screen is not supported in debug
///      mode.
///   2. Press the Play button in Xcode to build and run the app.
///   3. Create some in-memory state in the app on the phone,
///      e.g. by navigating to a different screen.
///   4. Background the app on the phone, e.g. by going back to the home screen.
///   5. Press the Stop button in Xcode to terminate the app while running in
///      the background.
///   6. Open the app again on the phone (not via Xcode). It will restart
///      and restore its state.

/// tree is serializable and must contain all the data an application needs to
/// restore its current state at a later point in time.
///
/// A [RestorationBucket] stores restoration data as key-value pairs. The key is
/// a [String] representing a restoration ID that identifies a piece of data
/// uniquely within a bucket. The value can be anything that is serializable via
/// the [StandardMessageCodec]. Furthermore, a [RestorationBucket] may have
/// child buckets, which are identified within their parent via a unique
/// restoration ID as well.
///
/// During state restoration, the data previously stored in the
/// [RestorationBucket] hierarchy will be made available again to the
/// application to restore it to the state it had when the data was collected.
/// State restoration to a previous state may happen when the app is launched
/// (e.g. after it has been terminated gracefully while running in the
/// background) or after the app has already been running for a while.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// A [RestorationBucket] is rarely instantiated directly via its constructors.
/// Instead, when an entity wants to store data in or retrieve data from a
/// restoration bucket, it typically obtains a child bucket from a parent by
/// calling [claimChild]. If no parent is available,
/// [RestorationManager.rootBucket] may be used as a parent. When claiming a
/// child, the claimer must provide the restoration ID of the child it would
/// like to own. A child bucket with a given restoration ID can at most have
/// one owner. If another owner tries to claim a bucket with the same ID from
/// the same parent, an exception is thrown (see discussion in [claimChild]).
/// The restoration IDs that a given owner uses to claim a child (and to store
/// data in that child, see below) must be stable across app launches to ensure
/// that after the app restarts the owner can retrieve the same data again that
/// it stored during a previous run.
///
/// Per convention, the owner of the bucket has exclusive access to the values
/// stored in the bucket. It can read, add, modify, and remove values via the
/// [read], [write], and [remove] methods. In general, the owner should store
/// all the data in the bucket that it needs to restore its current state. If
/// its current state changes, the data in the bucket must be updated. At the
/// same time, the data in the bucket should be kept to a minimum. For example,
/// for data that can be retrieved from other sources (like a database or
/// web service) only enough information (e.g. an ID or resource locator) to
/// re-obtain that data should be stored in the bucket. In addition to managing
/// the data in a bucket, an owner may also make the bucket available to other
/// entities so they can claim child buckets from it via [claimChild] for their
/// own restoration needs.
///
/// The bucket returned by [claimChild] may either contain state information
/// that the owner had previously (e.g. during a previous run of the
/// application) stored in it or it may be empty. If the bucket contains data,
/// the owner is expected to restore its state with the information previously
/// stored in the bucket. If the bucket is empty, it may initialize itself to
/// default values.
///
/// When the data stored in a bucket is no longer needed to restore the
/// application to its current state (e.g. because the owner of the bucket is no
/// longer shown on screen), the bucket must be [dispose]d. This will remove all
/// information stored in the bucket from the app's restoration data and that
/// information will not be available again when the application is restored to
/// this state in the future.
