  ///    of the text control. The second argument is an object with seven keys,
  ///    in the form expected by [TextEditingValue.fromJSON].
  ///
  ///  * `TextInputClient.updateEditingStateWithTag`: One or more text controls
  ///    were autofilled by the platform's autofill service. The first argument
  ///    (the client ID) is ignored, the second argument is a map of tags to
  ///    objects in the form expected by [TextEditingValue.fromJSON]. See

  ///    the tag.
  ///
  ///  * `TextInputClient.performAction`: The user has triggered an action. The
  ///    second argument is a [String] consisting of the stringification of one
  ///    of the values of the [TextInputAction] enum.
  ///
  ///  * `TextInputClient.requestExistingInputState`: The embedding may have
  ///    lost its internal state about the current editing client, if there is
  ///    one. The framework should call `TextInput.setClient` and
  ///    `TextInput.setEditingState` again with its most recent information. If
  ///    there is no existing state on the framework side, the call should
  ///    fizzle. (This call is made without a client ID; indeed, without any

  ///  * `TextInputClient.onConnectionClosed`: The text input connection closed
  ///    on the platform side. For example the application is moved to
  ///    background or used closed the virtual keyboard. This method informs
  ///    [TextInputClient] to clear connection and finalize editing.
