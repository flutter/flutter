/// severe setting, and  if it is set, it
/// will cause the tree to remain marked sensitive even if there are other
/// `SensitiveContent` widgets in the tree. [ContentSensitivity.autoSensitive]
/// is the second most severe setting, and it will cause the tree to remain marked
/// auto-sensitive if there are either (1) no other [SensitiveContent] widgets in the tree or (2) there are only other auto-sensitive or not sensitive
/// `SensitiveContent` widgets in the tree. [ContentSensitive.notSensitive]
/// is the least severe setting, and it will cause the tree to remain marked not
/// sensitive as long as there are (1) no other [SensitiveContent] widgets in the tree or (2) there are only other not sensitive `SensitiveContent`
/// widgets in the tree. If there are no `SensitiveContent` widgets in the tree,
/// the default setting as queried from the embedding will be used. This could be
/// set by a Flutter developer in native Android; otherwise, Android uses [ContentSensitivity.autoSensitive] by default.
