/// auto-sensitive if there are either (1) no other [SensitiveContent] widgets in the tree or (2) there are only other auto-sensitive or not sensitive

/// sensitive as long as there are (1) no other [SensitiveContent] widgets in the tree or (2) there are only other not sensitive `SensitiveContent`
/// widgets in the tree. If there are no `SensitiveContent` widgets in the tree,
