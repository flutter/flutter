  /// The arguments have the following meanings:
  ///
  ///  * `context`: The context in which the route is being built.
  ///  * [animation]: The animation for this route's transition. When entering,
  ///    the animation runs forward from 0.0 to 1.0. When exiting, this animation
  ///    runs backwards from 1.0 to 0.0.
  ///  * [secondaryAnimation]: The animation for the route being pushed on top of
  ///    this route. This animation lets this route coordinate with the entrance
  ///    and exit transition of routes pushed on top of this route.
  ///
  /// This method is only called when the route is first built, and rarely
  /// thereafter. In particular, it is not automatically called again when the
  /// route's state changes unless it uses [ModalRoute.of]. For a builder that
  /// is called every time the route's state changes, consider
  /// [buildTransitions]. For widgets that change their behavior when the
  /// route's state changes, consider [ModalRoute.of] to obtain a reference to
  /// the route; this will cause the widget to be rebuilt each time the route
  /// changes state.
  ///
  /// In general, [buildPage] should be used to build the page contents, and
  /// [buildTransitions] for the widgets that change as the page is brought in
  /// and out of view. Avoid using [buildTransitions] for content that never
  /// changes; building such content once from [buildPage] is more efficient.
  Widget buildPage(BuildContext context, Animation<double> animation, Animation<double> secondaryAnimation);

  /// Override this method to wrap the [child] with one or more transition
  /// widgets that define how the route arrives on and leaves the screen.
  ///
  /// By default, the child (which contains the widget returned by [buildPage])
  /// is not wrapped in any transition widgets.
  ///
  /// The [buildTransitions] method, in contrast to [buildPage], is called each
  /// time the [Route]'s state changes while it is visible (e.g. if the value of
  /// [canPop] changes on the active route).
  ///
  /// The [buildTransitions] method is typically used to define transitions
  /// that animate the new topmost route's comings and goings. When the
  /// [Navigator] pushes a route on the top of its stack, the new route's
  /// primary [animation] runs from 0.0 to 1.0. When the Navigator pops the
  /// topmost route, e.g. because the use pressed the back button, the
  /// primary animation runs from 1.0 to 0.0.
  ///
  /// {@tool snippet}
  /// The following example uses the primary animation to drive a
  /// [SlideTransition] that translates the top of the new route vertically
  /// from the bottom of the screen when it is pushed on the Navigator's
  /// stack. When the route is popped the SlideTransition translates the
  /// route from the top of the screen back to the bottom.
