/// Applies an [ImageFilter] to its child.
///
/// An image filter will always apply its filter operation to the child widget,
/// even if said filter is conceptually a "no-op", such as an ImageFilter.blur
/// with a radius of 0 or an ImageFilter.matrix with an identity matrix. Setting
/// [ImageFiltered.enabled] to `false` is a more efficient manner of disabling
/// an image filter.
///
/// The framework does not attempt to optimize out "no-op" filters because it
/// cannot tell the difference between an intentional no-op and a filter that is
/// only incidentally a no-op. Consider an ImageFilter.matrix that is animated
/// and happens to pass through the identity matrix. If the framework identified it
/// as a no-op it would drop and then recreate the layer during the animation which
/// would be more expensive than keeping it around.
