/// ## Discussion
///
/// Heroes and the [Navigator]'s [Overlay] [Stack] must be axis-aligned for
/// all this to work. The top left and bottom right coordinates of each animated
/// Hero will be converted to global coordinates and then from there converted
/// to that [Stack]'s coordinate space, and the entire Hero subtree will, for
/// the duration of the animation, be lifted out of its original place, and
/// positioned on that stack. If the [Hero] isn't axis aligned, this is going to
/// fail in a rather ugly fashion. Don't rotate your heroes!
///
/// To make the animations look good, it's critical that the widget tree for the
/// hero in both locations be essentially identical. The widget of the *target*
/// is, by default, used to do the transition: when going from route A to route
/// B, route B's hero's widget is placed over route A's hero's widget. Additionally,
/// if the [Hero] subtree changes appearance based on an [InheritedWidget] (such
/// as [MediaQuery] or [Theme]), then the hero animation may have discontinuity
/// at the start or the end of the animation because route A and route B provides
/// different such [InheritedWidget]s. Consider providing a custom [flightShuttleBuilder]
/// to ensure smooth transitions. The default [flightShuttleBuilder] interpolates
/// [MediaQuery]'s paddings. If your [Hero] widget uses custom [InheritedWidget]s
/// and displays a discontinuity in the animation, try to provide custom in-flight
/// transition using [flightShuttleBuilder].
///
/// By default, both route A and route B's heroes are hidden while the
/// transitioning widget is animating in-flight above the 2 routes.
/// [placeholderBuilder] can be used to show a custom widget in their place
/// instead once the transition has taken flight.
///
/// During the transition, the transition widget is animated to route B's hero's
/// position, and then the widget is inserted into route B. When going back from
/// B to A, route A's hero's widget is, by default, placed over where route B's
/// hero's widget was, and then the animation goes the other way.
///
/// ### Nested Navigators
///
/// If either or both routes contain nested [Navigator]s, only [Hero]es
/// contained in the top-most routes (as defined by [Route.isCurrent]) *of those
/// nested [Navigator]s* are considered for animation. Just like in the
/// non-nested case the top-most routes containing these [Hero]es in the nested
/// [Navigator]s have to be [PageRoute]s.
