///
/// This widget is useful for performing short animations that would otherwise
/// be expensive or that cannot rely on raster caching. For example, scale and
/// skew animations are often expensive to perform on complex children, as are
/// blurs. For a short animation, a widget that contains these expensive effects
/// can be replaced with a snapshot of itself and manipulated instead.
///
/// For example, the Android Q [ZoomPageTransitionsBuilder] uses a snapshot widget
/// for the forward and entering route to avoid the expensive scale animation.
/// This also has the effect of briefly pausing any animations on the page.
///
/// Generally, this widget should not be used in places where users expect the
/// child widget to continue animating or to be responsive, such as an unbounded
/// animation.

///
/// * The contents of platform views cannot be captured by a snapshot
///   widget. If a platform view is encountered, then the snapshot widget will
///   determine how to render its children based on the [SnapshotMode]. This
///   defaults to [SnapshotMode.normal] which will throw an exception if a
///   platform view is encountered.
///
/// * The snapshotting functionality of this widget is not supported on the HTML
///   backend of Flutter for the Web. Setting [SnapshotController.allowSnapshotting] to true
///   may cause an error to be thrown. On the CanvasKit backend of Flutter, the
///   performance of using this widget may regress performance due to the fact
