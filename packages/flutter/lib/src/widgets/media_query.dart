/// ## Insets and Padding
///
/// ![A diagram of padding, viewInsets, and viewPadding in correlation with each
/// other](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/media_query.png)
///
/// This diagram illustrates how [padding] relates to [viewPadding] and
/// [viewInsets], shown here in its simplest configuration, as the difference
/// between the two. In cases when the viewInsets exceed the viewPadding, like
/// when a software keyboard is shown below, padding goes to zero rather than a
/// negative value. Therefore, padding is calculated by taking
/// `max(0.0, viewPadding - viewInsets)`.
///
/// {@animation 300 300 https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/window_padding.mp4}
///
/// In this diagram, the black areas represent system UI that the app cannot
/// draw over. The red area represents view padding that the application may not
/// be able to detect gestures in and may not want to draw in. The grey area
/// represents the system keyboard, which can cover over the bottom view padding
/// when visible.
///
/// MediaQueryData includes three [EdgeInsets] values:
/// [padding], [viewPadding], and [viewInsets]. These values reflect the
/// configuration of the device and are used and optionally consumed by widgets
/// that position content within these insets. The padding value defines areas
/// that might not be completely visible, like the display "notch" on the iPhone
/// X. The viewInsets value defines areas that aren't visible at all, typically
/// because they're obscured by the device's keyboard. Similar to viewInsets,
/// viewPadding does not differentiate padding in areas that may be obscured.
/// For example, by using the viewPadding property, padding would defer to the
/// iPhone "safe area" regardless of whether a keyboard is showing.
///
/// The viewInsets and viewPadding are independent values, they're
/// measured from the edges of the MediaQuery widget's bounds. Together they
/// inform the [padding] property. The bounds of the top level MediaQuery
/// created by [WidgetsApp] are the same as the window that contains the app.
///
/// Widgets whose layouts consume space defined by [viewInsets], [viewPadding],
/// or [padding] should enclose their children in secondary MediaQuery
/// widgets that reduce those properties by the same amount.
/// The [removePadding], [removeViewPadding], and [removeViewInsets] methods are
/// useful for this.
/// See also:
///
/// * [Scaffold], [SafeArea], [CupertinoTabScaffold], and
/// [CupertinoPageScaffold], all of which are informed by [padding],
/// [viewPadding], and [viewInsets].
