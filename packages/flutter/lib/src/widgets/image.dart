/// ## Memory usage
///
/// The image is stored in memory in uncompressed form (so that it can be
/// rendered). Large images will use a lot of memory: a 4K image (3840×2160)
/// will use over 30MB of RAM (assuming 32 bits per pixel).
///
/// This problem is exacerbated by the images being cached in the [ImageCache],
/// so large images can use memory for even longer than they are displayed.
///
/// The [Image.asset], [Image.network], [Image.file], and [Image.memory]
/// constructors allow a custom decode size to be specified through `cacheWidth`
/// and `cacheHeight` parameters. The engine will then decode and store the
/// image at the specified size, instead of the image's natural size.
///
/// This can significantly reduce the memory usage. For example, a 4K image that
/// will be rendered at only 384×216 pixels (one-tenth the horizontal and
/// vertical dimensions) would only use 330KB if those dimensions are specified
/// using the `cacheWidth` and `cacheHeight` parameters, a 100-fold reduction in
/// memory usage.
///
/// ## Custom image providers
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// In this example, a variant of [NetworkImage] is created that passes all the
/// [ImageConfiguration] information (locale, platform, size, etc) to the server
/// using query arguments in the image URL.

  ///

  /// We have constructed a 'Person' widget that displays an avatar [Image] of

  /// with a blank image.
  ///
  /// * Option B ([gaplessPlayback] = true): The widget displays the avatar of
  /// the previous person and the name of the newly loaded person.
  ///
  /// This is why the default value is false. Most of the time, when you change
  /// the image provider you're not just changing the image, you're removing the
  /// old widget and adding a new one and not expecting them to have any
  /// relationship. With [gaplessPlayback] on you might accidentally break this
  /// expectation and re-use the old widget.
