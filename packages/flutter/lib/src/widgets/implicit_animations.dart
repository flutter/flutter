/// An abstract class for building widgets that animate changes to their
/// properties.
///
/// Widgets of this type will not animate when they are first added to the
/// widget tree. Rather, when they are rebuilt with different values, they will
/// respond to those _changes_ by animating the changes over a specified
/// [duration].
///
/// Which properties are animated is left up to the subclass. Subclasses' [State]s
/// must extend [ImplicitlyAnimatedWidgetState] and provide a way to visit the
/// relevant fields to animate.
///
/// ## Relationship to [AnimatedWidget]s
///
/// [ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget]s (and their subclasses) automatically animate
/// changes in their properties whenever they change. For this,
/// they create and manage their own internal [AnimationController]s to power
/// the animation. While these widgets are simple to use and don't require you
/// to manually manage the lifecycle of an [AnimationController], they
/// are also somewhat limited: Besides the target value for the animated
/// property, developers can only choose a [duration] and [curve] for the
/// animation. If you require more control over the animation (e.g. you want
/// to stop it somewhere in the middle), consider using an
/// [AnimatedWidget] or one of its subclasses. These widgets take an [Animation]
/// as an argument to power the animation. This gives the developer full control
/// over the animation at the cost of requiring you to manually manage the
/// underlying [AnimationController].
///
/// ## Common implicitly animated widgets
///
/// A number of implicitly animated widgets ship with the framework. They are
/// usually named `AnimatedFoo`, where `Foo` is the name of the non-animated
/// version of that widget. Commonly used implicitly animated widgets include:
///
///  * [TweenAnimationBuilder], which animates any property expressed by
///    a [Tween] to a specified target value.
///  * [AnimatedAlign], which is an implicitly animated version of [Align].
///  * [AnimatedContainer], which is an implicitly animated version of
///    [Container].
///  * [AnimatedDefaultTextStyle], which is an implicitly animated version of
///    [DefaultTextStyle].
///  * [AnimatedScale], which is an implicitly animated version of [Transform.scale].
///  * [AnimatedRotation], which is an implicitly animated version of [Transform.rotate].
///  * [AnimatedSlide], which implicitly animates the position of a widget relative to its normal position.
///  * [AnimatedOpacity], which is an implicitly animated version of [Opacity].
///  * [AnimatedPadding], which is an implicitly animated version of [Padding].
///  * [AnimatedPhysicalModel], which is an implicitly animated version of
///    [PhysicalModel].
///  * [AnimatedPositioned], which is an implicitly animated version of
///    [Positioned].
///  * [AnimatedPositionedDirectional], which is an implicitly animated version
///    of [PositionedDirectional].
///  * [AnimatedTheme], which is an implicitly animated version of [Theme].
///  * [AnimatedCrossFade], which cross-fades between two given children and
///    animates itself between their sizes.
///  * [AnimatedSize], which automatically transitions its size over a given
///    duration.
///  * [AnimatedSwitcher], which fades from one widget to another.

  /// follows:
  ///
  /// {@macro flutter.widgets.TweenVisitor.arguments}
  ///
  /// ### When this method will be called
  ///
  /// [forEachTween] is initially called during [initState]. It is expected that
  /// the visitor's `tween` argument will be set to null, causing the visitor to
  /// call its `constructor` argument to construct the tween for the first time.
  /// The resulting tween will have its `begin` value set to the target value
  /// and will have its `end` value set to null. The animation will not be
  /// started.
  ///
  /// When this state's [widget] is updated (thus triggering the
  /// [didUpdateWidget] method to be called), [forEachTween] will be called
  /// again to check if the target value has changed. If the target value has
  /// changed, signaling that the [animation] should start, then the visitor
  /// will update the tween's `start` and `end` values accordingly, and the
  /// animation will be started.
  ///
  /// ### Other member variables
  ///

  /// [forEachTween] should override [didUpdateTweens] to update those
  /// properties. Dependent properties should not be updated within
  /// [forEachTween].
