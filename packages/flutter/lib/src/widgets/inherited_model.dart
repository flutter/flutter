/// An [InheritedWidget] that's intended to be used as the base class for models
/// whose dependents may only depend on one part or "aspect" of the overall
/// model.
///
/// An inherited widget's dependents are unconditionally rebuilt when the
/// inherited widget changes per [InheritedWidget.updateShouldNotify]. This
/// widget is similar except that dependents aren't rebuilt unconditionally.
///
/// Widgets that depend on an [InheritedModel] qualify their dependence with a
/// value that indicates what "aspect" of the model they depend on. When the
/// model is rebuilt, dependents will also be rebuilt, but only if there was a
/// change in the model that corresponds to the aspect they provided.
///
/// The type parameter `T` is the type of the model aspect objects.
///
/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml5uefGgkaA}
///
/// Widgets create a dependency on an [InheritedModel] with a static method:
/// [InheritedModel.inheritFrom]. This method's `context` parameter defines the
/// subtree that will be rebuilt when the model changes. Typically the
/// `inheritFrom` method is called from a model-specific static `maybeOf` or
/// `of` methods, a convention that is present in many Flutter framework classes
/// which look things up. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyModel extends InheritedModel<String> {
///   const MyModel({super.key, required super.child});
///
///   // ...
///   static MyModel? maybeOf(BuildContext context, [String? aspect]) {
///     return InheritedModel.inheritFrom<MyModel>(context, aspect: aspect);
///   }
///
///   // ...
///   static MyModel of(BuildContext context, [String? aspect]) {
///     final MyModel? result = maybeOf(context, aspect);
///     assert(result != null, 'Unable to find an instance of MyModel...');
///     return result!;
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Calling `MyModel.of(context, 'foo')` or `MyModel.maybeOf(context,
/// 'foo')` means that `context` should only be rebuilt when the `foo` aspect of
/// `MyModel` changes. If the `aspect` is null, then the model supports all
/// aspects.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// When the inherited model is rebuilt the [updateShouldNotify] and
/// [updateShouldNotifyDependent] methods are used to decide what should be
/// rebuilt. If [updateShouldNotify] returns true, then the inherited model's
/// [updateShouldNotifyDependent] method is tested for each dependent and the
/// set of aspect objects it depends on. The [updateShouldNotifyDependent]
/// method must compare the set of aspect dependencies with the changes in the
/// model itself. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// class ABModel extends InheritedModel<String> {
///   const ABModel({
///    super.key,
///    this.a,
///    this.b,
///    required super.child,
///   });
///
///   final int? a;
///   final int? b;
///
///   @override
///   bool updateShouldNotify(ABModel oldWidget) {
///     return a != oldWidget.a || b != oldWidget.b;
///   }
///
///   @override
///   bool updateShouldNotifyDependent(ABModel oldWidget, Set<String> dependencies) {
///     return (a != oldWidget.a && dependencies.contains('a'))
///       || (b != oldWidget.b && dependencies.contains('b'));
///   }
///
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// In the previous example the dependencies checked by
/// [updateShouldNotifyDependent] are just the aspect strings passed to
/// `dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType`. They're represented as a [Set] because
/// one Widget can depend on more than one aspect of the model. If a widget
/// depends on the model but doesn't specify an aspect, then changes in the
/// model will cause the widget to be rebuilt unconditionally.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example shows how to implement [InheritedModel] to rebuild a widget
/// based on a qualified dependence. When tapped on the "Resize Logo" button
/// only the logo widget is rebuilt while the background widget remains
/// unaffected.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/inherited_model/inherited_model.0.dart **
