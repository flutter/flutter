/// spacing between widgets in a [Flex] container, like [Row] or [Column].

/// The [Spacer] widget will take up any available space, so setting the
/// [Flex.mainAxisAlignment] on a flex container that contains a [Spacer] to
/// [MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround], [MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween], or
/// [MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly] will not have any visible effect: the
/// [Spacer] has taken up all of the additional space, therefore there is none
/// left to redistribute.
