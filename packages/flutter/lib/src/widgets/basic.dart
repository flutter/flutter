// PAINTING NODES

/// A widget that makes its child partially transparent.
///
/// This class paints its child into an intermediate buffer and then blends the
/// child back into the scene partially transparent.
///
/// For values of opacity other than 0.0 and 1.0, this class is relatively
/// expensive because it requires painting the child into an intermediate
/// buffer. For the value 0.0, the child is not painted at all. For the
/// value 1.0, the child is painted immediately without an intermediate buffer.
///
/// The presence of the intermediate buffer which has a transparent background
/// by default may cause some child widgets to behave differently. For example
/// a [BackdropFilter] child will only be able to apply its filter to the content
/// between this widget and the backdrop child and may require adjusting the
/// [BackdropFilter.blendMode] property to produce the desired results.
///
/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hltevOHQBw}
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// This example shows some [Text] when the `_visible` member field is true, and
/// hides it when it is false:
///
/// ```dart
/// Opacity(
///   opacity: _visible ? 1.0 : 0.0,
///   child: const Text("Now you see me, now you don't!"),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// This is more efficient than adding and removing the child widget from the
/// tree on demand.
///
/// ## Performance considerations for opacity animation
///
/// Animating an [Opacity] widget directly causes the widget (and possibly its
/// subtree) to rebuild each frame, which is not very efficient. Consider using
/// one of these alternative widgets instead:
///
///  * [AnimatedOpacity], which uses an animation internally to efficiently
///    animate opacity.
///  * [FadeTransition], which uses a provided animation to efficiently animate
///    opacity.
///
/// ## Transparent image
///
/// If only a single [Image] or [Color] needs to be composited with an opacity
/// between 0.0 and 1.0, it's much faster to directly use them without [Opacity]
/// widgets.
///
/// For example, `Container(color: Color.fromRGBO(255, 0, 0, 0.5))` is much
/// faster than `Opacity(opacity: 0.5, child: Container(color: Colors.red))`.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// The following example draws an [Image] with 0.5 opacity without using
/// [Opacity]:
///
/// ```dart
/// Image.network(
///   'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/assets-for-api-docs/main/packages/diagrams/assets/blend_mode_destination.jpeg',
///   color: const Color.fromRGBO(255, 255, 255, 0.5),
///   colorBlendMode: BlendMode.modulate
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// Directly drawing an [Image] or [Color] with opacity is faster than using
/// [Opacity] on top of them because [Opacity] could apply the opacity to a
/// group of widgets and therefore a costly offscreen buffer will be used.
/// Drawing content into the offscreen buffer may also trigger render target
/// switches and such switching is particularly slow in older GPUs.
///
/// ## Hit testing
///
/// Setting the [opacity] to zero does not prevent hit testing from being applied
/// to the descendants of the [Opacity] widget. This can be confusing for the
/// user, who may not see anything, and may believe the area of the interface
/// where the [Opacity] is hiding a widget to be non-interactive.
///
/// With certain widgets, such as [Flow], that compute their positions only when
/// they are painted, this can actually lead to bugs (from unexpected geometry
/// to exceptions), because those widgets are not painted by the [Opacity]
/// widget at all when the [opacity] is zero.
///
/// To avoid such problems, it is generally a good idea to use an
/// [IgnorePointer] widget when setting the [opacity] to zero. This prevents
/// interactions with any children in the subtree.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Visibility], which can hide a child more efficiently (albeit less
///    subtly, because it is either visible or hidden, rather than allowing
///    fractional opacity values). Specifically, the [Visibility.maintain]
///    constructor is equivalent to using an opacity widget with values of
///    `0.0` or `1.0`.
///  * [ShaderMask], which can apply more elaborate effects to its child.
///  * [Transform], which applies an arbitrary transform to its child widget at
///    paint time.
///  * [SliverOpacity], the sliver version of this widget.

/// current canvas, then it paints its child, and then, after painting its
/// child, it asks its [foregroundPainter] to paint. The coordinate system of the
/// canvas matches the coordinate system of the [CustomPaint] object. The
/// painters are expected to paint within a rectangle starting at the origin and
/// encompassing a region of the given size. (If the painters paint outside
/// those bounds, there might be insufficient memory allocated to rasterize the
/// painting commands and the resulting behavior is undefined.) To enforce
/// painting within those bounds, consider wrapping this [CustomPaint] with a
/// [ClipRect] widget.

/// verbose.
///
/// To cause a child to expand to fill the available space in the [direction]
/// of this widget's main axis, wrap the child in an [Expanded] widget.

/// The [Flex] widget does not scroll (and in general it is considered an error
/// to have more children in a [Flex] than will fit in the available room). If
/// you have some widgets and want them to be able to scroll if there is
/// insufficient room, consider using a [ListView].
///
/// The [Flex] widget does not allow its children to wrap across multiple
/// horizontal or vertical runs. For a widget that allows its children to wrap,
/// consider using the [Wrap] widget instead of [Flex].
///
/// If you only have one child, then rather than using [Flex], [Row], or
/// [Column], consider using [Align] or [Center] to position the child.
///
/// ## Layout algorithm
///
/// _This section describes how a [Flex] is rendered by the framework._
/// _See [BoxConstraints] for an introduction to box layout models._
///
/// Layout for a [Flex] proceeds in six steps:
///
/// 1. Layout each child with a null or zero flex factor (e.g., those that are
///    not [Expanded]) with unbounded main axis constraints and the incoming
///    cross axis constraints. If the [crossAxisAlignment] is
///    [CrossAxisAlignment.stretch], instead use tight cross axis constraints
///    that match the incoming max extent in the cross axis.
/// 2. Divide the remaining main axis space among the children with non-zero
///    flex factors (e.g., those that are [Expanded]) according to their flex
///    factor. For example, a child with a flex factor of 2.0 will receive twice
///    the amount of main axis space as a child with a flex factor of 1.0.
/// 3. Layout each of the remaining children with the same cross axis
///    constraints as in step 1, but instead of using unbounded main axis
///    constraints, use max axis constraints based on the amount of space
///    allocated in step 2. Children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.tight] are given tight constraints (i.e., forced to fill the
///    allocated space), and children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.loose] are given loose constraints (i.e., not forced to fill the
///    allocated space).
/// 4. The cross axis extent of the [Flex] is the maximum cross axis extent of
///    the children (which will always satisfy the incoming constraints).
/// 5. The main axis extent of the [Flex] is determined by the [mainAxisSize]
///    property. If the [mainAxisSize] property is [MainAxisSize.max], then the
///    main axis extent of the [Flex] is the max extent of the incoming main
///    axis constraints. If the [mainAxisSize] property is [MainAxisSize.min],
///    then the main axis extent of the [Flex] is the sum of the main axis
///    extents of the children (subject to the incoming constraints).
/// 6. Determine the position for each child according to the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] and the [crossAxisAlignment]. For example, if the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] is [MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween], any main axis
///    space that has not been allocated to children is divided evenly and
///    placed between the children.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Row], for a version of this widget that is always horizontal.
///  * [Column], for a version of this widget that is always vertical.
///  * [Expanded], to indicate children that should take all the remaining room.
///  * [Flexible], to indicate children that should share the remaining room.
///  * [Spacer], a widget that takes up space proportional to its flex value.
///    that may be sized smaller (leaving some remaining room unused).
///  * [Wrap], for a widget that allows its children to wrap over multiple _runs_.

///
/// If the non-flexible contents of the row (those that are not wrapped in
/// [Expanded] or [Flexible] widgets) are together wider than the row itself,
/// then the row is said to have overflowed. When a row overflows, the row does
/// not have any remaining space to share between its [Expanded] and [Flexible]
/// children. The row reports this by drawing a yellow and black striped
/// warning box on the edge that is overflowing. If there is room on the outside
/// of the row, the amount of overflow is printed in red lettering.
///
/// #### Story time
///
/// Suppose, for instance, that you had this code:
///
/// ```dart
/// const Row(
///   children: <Widget>[
///     FlutterLogo(),
///     Text("Flutter's hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bug faster. Experience sub-second reload times, without losing state, on emulators, simulators, and hardware for iOS and Android."),
///     Icon(Icons.sentiment_very_satisfied),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
///
/// The row first asks its first child, the [FlutterLogo], to lay out, at
/// whatever size the logo would like. The logo is friendly and happily decides
/// to be 24 pixels to a side. This leaves lots of room for the next child. The
/// row then asks that next child, the text, to lay out, at whatever size it
/// thinks is best.
///
/// At this point, the text, not knowing how wide is too wide, says "Ok, I will

/// have no more room available for my other children!", and gets angry and

///
/// The fix is to wrap the second child in an [Expanded] widget, which tells the

///
/// ```dart
/// const Row(
///   children: <Widget>[
///     FlutterLogo(),
///     Expanded(
///       child: Text("Flutter's hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bug faster. Experience sub-second reload times, without losing state, on emulators, simulators, and hardware for iOS and Android."),
///     ),
///     Icon(Icons.sentiment_very_satisfied),

/// ```
///
/// Now, the row first asks the logo to lay out, and then asks the _icon_ to lay
/// out. The [Icon], like the logo, is happy to take on a reasonable size (also
/// 24 pixels, not coincidentally, since both [FlutterLogo] and [Icon] honor the
/// ambient [IconTheme]). This leaves some room left over, and now the row tells
/// the text exactly how wide to be: the exact width of the remaining space. The

/// The [textDirection] property controls the direction that children are rendered in.

///
/// ## Layout algorithm
///
/// _This section describes how a [Row] is rendered by the framework._
/// _See [BoxConstraints] for an introduction to box layout models._
///
/// Layout for a [Row] proceeds in six steps:
///
/// 1. Layout each child with a null or zero flex factor (e.g., those that are
///    not [Expanded]) with unbounded horizontal constraints and the incoming
///    vertical constraints. If the [crossAxisAlignment] is
///    [CrossAxisAlignment.stretch], instead use tight vertical constraints that
///    match the incoming max height.
/// 2. Divide the remaining horizontal space among the children with non-zero
///    flex factors (e.g., those that are [Expanded]) according to their flex
///    factor. For example, a child with a flex factor of 2.0 will receive twice
///    the amount of horizontal space as a child with a flex factor of 1.0.
/// 3. Layout each of the remaining children with the same vertical constraints
///    as in step 1, but instead of using unbounded horizontal constraints, use
///    horizontal constraints based on the amount of space allocated in step 2.
///    Children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are [FlexFit.tight] are
///    given tight constraints (i.e., forced to fill the allocated space), and
///    children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are [FlexFit.loose] are
///    given loose constraints (i.e., not forced to fill the allocated space).
/// 4. The height of the [Row] is the maximum height of the children (which will
///    always satisfy the incoming vertical constraints).
/// 5. The width of the [Row] is determined by the [mainAxisSize] property. If
///    the [mainAxisSize] property is [MainAxisSize.max], then the width of the
///    [Row] is the max width of the incoming constraints. If the [mainAxisSize]
///    property is [MainAxisSize.min], then the width of the [Row] is the sum
///    of widths of the children (subject to the incoming constraints).
/// 6. Determine the position for each child according to the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] and the [crossAxisAlignment]. For example, if the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] is [MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween], any horizontal
///    space that has not been allocated to children is divided evenly and
///    placed between the children.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Column], for a vertical equivalent.
///  * [Flex], if you don't know in advance if you want a horizontal or vertical
///    arrangement.
///  * [Expanded], to indicate children that should take all the remaining room.
///  * [Flexible], to indicate children that should share the remaining room but
///    that may by sized smaller (leaving some remaining room unused).
///  * [Spacer], a widget that takes up space proportional to its flex value.

/// ## Troubleshooting
///
/// ### When the incoming vertical constraints are unbounded
///
/// When a [Column] has one or more [Expanded] or [Flexible] children, and is
/// placed in another [Column], or in a [ListView], or in some other context
/// that does not provide a maximum height constraint for the [Column], you will
/// get an exception at runtime saying that there are children with non-zero
/// flex but the vertical constraints are unbounded.
///
/// The problem, as described in the details that accompany that exception, is
/// that using [Flexible] or [Expanded] means that the remaining space after
/// laying out all the other children must be shared equally, but if the
/// incoming vertical constraints are unbounded, there is infinite remaining
/// space.
///
/// The key to solving this problem is usually to determine why the [Column] is
/// receiving unbounded vertical constraints.
///
/// One common reason for this to happen is that the [Column] has been placed in
/// another [Column] (without using [Expanded] or [Flexible] around the inner
/// nested [Column]). When a [Column] lays out its non-flex children (those that
/// have neither [Expanded] or [Flexible] around them), it gives them unbounded
/// constraints so that they can determine their own dimensions (passing
/// unbounded constraints usually signals to the child that it should
/// shrink-wrap its contents). The solution in this case is typically to just
/// wrap the inner column in an [Expanded] to indicate that it should take the
/// remaining space of the outer column, rather than being allowed to take any
/// amount of room it desires.
///
/// Another reason for this message to be displayed is nesting a [Column] inside
/// a [ListView] or other vertical scrollable. In that scenario, there really is
/// infinite vertical space (the whole point of a vertical scrolling list is to
/// allow infinite space vertically). In such scenarios, it is usually worth
/// examining why the inner [Column] should have an [Expanded] or [Flexible]
/// child: what size should the inner children really be? The solution in this
/// case is typically to remove the [Expanded] or [Flexible] widgets from around
/// the inner children.
///

///
/// For more discussion about constraints, see [BoxConstraints].
///
/// ### The yellow and black striped banner
///
/// When the contents of a [Column] exceed the amount of space available, the
/// [Column] overflows, and the contents are clipped. In debug mode, a yellow
/// and black striped bar is rendered at the overflowing edge to indicate the
/// problem, and a message is printed below the [Column] saying how much
/// overflow was detected.
///
/// The usual solution is to use a [ListView] rather than a [Column], to enable
/// the contents to scroll when vertical space is limited.
///
/// ## Layout algorithm
///
/// _This section describes how a [Column] is rendered by the framework._
/// _See [BoxConstraints] for an introduction to box layout models._
///
/// Layout for a [Column] proceeds in six steps:
///
/// 1. Layout each child with a null or zero flex factor (e.g., those that are
///    not [Expanded]) with unbounded vertical constraints and the incoming
///    horizontal constraints. If the [crossAxisAlignment] is
///    [CrossAxisAlignment.stretch], instead use tight horizontal constraints
///    that match the incoming max width.
/// 2. Divide the remaining vertical space among the children with non-zero
///    flex factors (e.g., those that are [Expanded]) according to their flex
///    factor. For example, a child with a flex factor of 2.0 will receive twice
///    the amount of vertical space as a child with a flex factor of 1.0.
/// 3. Layout each of the remaining children with the same horizontal
///    constraints as in step 1, but instead of using unbounded vertical
///    constraints, use vertical constraints based on the amount of space
///    allocated in step 2. Children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.tight] are given tight constraints (i.e., forced to fill the
///    allocated space), and children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.loose] are given loose constraints (i.e., not forced to fill the
///    allocated space).
/// 4. The width of the [Column] is the maximum width of the children (which
///    will always satisfy the incoming horizontal constraints).
/// 5. The height of the [Column] is determined by the [mainAxisSize] property.
///    If the [mainAxisSize] property is [MainAxisSize.max], then the height of
///    the [Column] is the max height of the incoming constraints. If the
///    [mainAxisSize] property is [MainAxisSize.min], then the height of the
///    [Column] is the sum of heights of the children (subject to the incoming
///    constraints).
/// 6. Determine the position for each child according to the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] and the [crossAxisAlignment]. For example, if the

/// A widget that sizes and positions children efficiently, according to the
/// logic in a [FlowDelegate].
///
/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG6pvXpnIso}
///
/// Flow layouts are optimized for repositioning children using transformation
/// matrices.
///
/// The flow container is sized independently from the children by the
/// [FlowDelegate.getSize] function of the delegate. The children are then sized
/// independently given the constraints from the
/// [FlowDelegate.getConstraintsForChild] function.
///
/// Rather than positioning the children during layout, the children are
/// positioned using transformation matrices during the paint phase using the
/// matrices from the [FlowDelegate.paintChildren] function. The children can be
/// repositioned efficiently by only _repainting_ the flow, which happens
/// without the children being laid out again (contrast this with a [Stack],
/// which does the sizing and positioning together during layout).
///
/// The most efficient way to trigger a repaint of the flow is to supply an
/// animation to the constructor of the [FlowDelegate]. The flow will listen to
/// this animation and repaint whenever the animation ticks, avoiding both the
/// build and layout phases of the pipeline.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example uses the [Flow] widget to create a menu that opens and closes
/// as it is interacted with, shown above. The color of the button in the menu
/// changes to indicate which one has been selected.

/// ## Hit testing and hidden [Flow] widgets
///
/// The [Flow] widget recomputes its children's positions (as used by hit
/// testing) during the _paint_ phase rather than during the _layout_ phase.
///
/// Widgets like [Opacity] avoid painting their children when those children
/// would be invisible due to their opacity being zero.
///
/// Unfortunately, this means that hiding a [Flow] widget using an [Opacity]
/// widget will cause bugs when the user attempts to interact with the hidden
/// region, for example, by tapping it or clicking it.
///
/// Such bugs will manifest either as out-of-date geometry (taps going to
/// different widgets than might be expected by the currently-specified
/// [FlowDelegate]s), or exceptions (e.g. if the last time the [Flow] was
/// painted, a different set of children was specified).
///
/// To avoid this, when hiding a [Flow] widget with an [Opacity] widget (or
/// [AnimatedOpacity] or similar), it is wise to also disable hit testing on the
/// widget by using [IgnorePointer]. This is generally good advice anyway as
/// hit-testing invisible widgets is often confusing for the user.

  ///  * Otherwise, the outer widget very likely has access to the variable that
  ///    controls whether this [MouseRegion] is present. If so, call [onExit] at
  ///    the event that turns the condition from true to false.
  ///  * In cases where the solutions above won't work, you can always
  ///    override [State.dispose] and call [onExit], or create your own widget

/// Containing [RenderObject.paint] to parts of the render subtree that are

///
/// When a [RenderObject] is flagged as needing to paint via
/// [RenderObject.markNeedsPaint], the nearest ancestor [RenderObject] with
/// [RenderObject.isRepaintBoundary], up to possibly the root of the application,
/// is requested to repaint. That nearest ancestor's [RenderObject.paint] method
/// will cause _all_ of its descendant [RenderObject]s to repaint in the same
/// layer.
///
/// [RepaintBoundary] is therefore used, both while propagating the
/// `markNeedsPaint` flag up the render tree and while traversing down the
/// render tree via [PaintingContext.paintChild], to strategically contain
/// repaints to the render subtree that visually changed for performance. This
/// is done because the [RepaintBoundary] widget creates a [RenderObject] that
/// always has a [Layer], decoupling ancestor render objects from the descendant
/// render objects.
///
/// [RepaintBoundary] has the further side-effect of possibly hinting to the

/// while the surrounding tree changes frequently. In those cases, the engine
/// may choose to pay a one time cost of rasterizing and caching the pixel
/// values of the subtree for faster future GPU re-rendering speed.
///
/// Several framework widgets insert [RepaintBoundary] widgets to mark natural

/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXNOkIuSYuA}
///
/// This widget is an inline alternative to defining a [StatelessWidget]
/// subclass. For example, instead of defining a widget as follows:
///
/// ```dart
/// class Foo extends StatelessWidget {
///   const Foo({super.key});
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) => const Text('foo');
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ...and using it in the usual way:
///
/// ```dart
/// // continuing from previous example...
/// const Center(child: Foo())
/// ```
///
/// ...one could instead define and use it in a single step, without
/// defining a new widget class:
///
/// ```dart
/// Center(
///   child: Builder(
///     builder: (BuildContext context) => const Text('foo'),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// The difference between either of the previous examples and
/// creating a child directly without an intervening widget, is the
/// extra [BuildContext] element that the additional widget adds. This
/// is particularly noticeable when the tree contains an inherited
/// widget that is referred to by a method like [Scaffold.of],
/// which visits the child widget's BuildContext ancestors.
///
/// In the following example the button's `onPressed` callback is unable
/// to find the enclosing [ScaffoldState] with [Scaffold.of]:
///
/// ```dart
/// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///   return Scaffold(
///     body: Center(
///       child: TextButton(
///         onPressed: () {
///           // Fails because Scaffold.of() doesn't find anything
///           // above this widget's context.
///           print(Scaffold.of(context).hasAppBar);
///         },
///         child: const Text('hasAppBar'),
///       )
///     ),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A [Builder] widget introduces an additional [BuildContext] element
/// and so the [Scaffold.of] method succeeds.
///
/// ```dart
/// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///   return Scaffold(
///     body: Builder(
///       builder: (BuildContext context) {
///         return Center(
///           child: TextButton(
///             onPressed: () {
///               print(Scaffold.of(context).hasAppBar);
///             },
///             child: const Text('hasAppBar'),
///           ),
///         );
