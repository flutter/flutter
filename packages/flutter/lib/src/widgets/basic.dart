/// A widget that makes its child partially transparent.
///
/// This class paints its child into an intermediate buffer and then blends the
/// child back into the scene partially transparent.
///
/// For values of opacity other than 0.0 and 1.0, this class is relatively
/// expensive because it requires painting the child into an intermediate
/// buffer. For the value 0.0, the child is simply not painted at all. For the
/// value 1.0, the child is painted immediately without an intermediate buffer.
///
/// ## Sample code
///
/// This example shows some [Text] when the `_visible` member field is true, and
/// hides it when it is false:
///
/// ```dart
/// new Opacity(
///   opacity: _visible ? 1.0 : 0.0,
///   child: const Text('Now you see me, now you don\'t!'),

/// verbose.
///
/// To cause a child to expand to fill the available vertical space, wrap the
/// child in an [Expanded] widget.
///
/// The [Flex] widget does not scroll (and in general it is considered an error
/// to have more children in a [Flex] than will fit in the available room). If
/// you have some widgets and want them to be able to scroll if there is
/// insufficient room, consider using a [ListView].
///
/// If you only have one child, then rather than using [Flex], [Row], or
/// [Column], consider using [Align] or [Center] to position the child.
///
/// ## Layout algorithm
///
/// _This section describes how a [Flex] is rendered by the framework._
///
/// Layout for a [Flex] proceeds in six steps:
///
/// 1. Layout each child a null or zero flex factor (e.g., those that are not
///    [Expanded]) with unbounded main axis constraints and the incoming
///    cross axis constraints. If the [crossAxisAlignment] is
///    [CrossAxisAlignment.stretch], instead use tight cross axis constraints
///    that match the incoming max extent in the cross axis.
/// 2. Divide the remaining main axis space among the children with non-zero
///    flex factors (e.g., those that are [Expanded]) according to their flex
///    factor. For example, a child with a flex factor of 2.0 will receive twice
///    the amount of main axis space as a child with a flex factor of 1.0.
/// 3. Layout each of the remaining children with the same cross axis
///    constraints as in step 1, but instead of using unbounded main axis
///    constraints, use max axis constraints based on the amount of space
///    allocated in step 2. Children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.tight] are given tight constraints (i.e., forced to fill the
///    allocated space), and children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.loose] are given loose constraints (i.e., not forced to fill the
///    allocated space).
/// 4. The cross axis extent of the [Flex] is the maximum cross axis extent of
///    the children (which will always satisfy the incoming constraints).
/// 5. The main axis extent of the [Flex] is determined by the [mainAxisSize]
///    property. If the [mainAxisSize] property is [MainAxisSize.max], then the
///    main axis extent of the [Flex] is the max extent of the incoming main
///    axis constraints. If the [mainAxisSize] property is [MainAxisSize.min],
///    then the main axis extent of the [Flex] is the sum of the main axis
///    extents of the children (subject to the incoming constraints).
/// 6. Determine the position for each child according to the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] and the [crossAxisAlignment]. For example, if the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] is [MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween], any main axis
///    space that has not been allocated to children is divided evenly and
///    placed between the children.
///

/// A widget that displays its children in a horizontal array.

/// To cause a child to expand to fill the available horizontal space, wrap the

///

/// to have more children in a [Row] than will fit in the available room). If
/// you have a line of widgets and want them to be able to scroll if there is
/// insufficient room, consider using a [ListView].
///
/// For a vertical variant, see [Column].
///
/// If you only have one child, then consider using [Align] or [Center] to
/// position the child.
///
/// ## Sample code
///
/// This example divides the available space into three (horizontally), and
/// places text centered in the first two cells and the Flutter logo centered in
/// the third:
///
/// ```dart
/// new Row(
///   children: <Widget>[
///     new Expanded(
///       child: new Text('Deliver features faster', textAlign: TextAlign.center),
///     ),
///     new Expanded(
///       child: new Text('Craft beautiful UIs', textAlign: TextAlign.center),
///     ),
///     new Expanded(
///       child: new FittedBox(
///         fit: BoxFit.contain, // otherwise the logo will be tiny
///         child: const FlutterLogo(),
///       ),
///     ),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Troubleshooting
///
/// ### Why is my row turning red?
///
/// If the contents of the row overflow, meaning that together they are wider
/// than the row, then the row runs out of space to give its [Expanded] and
/// [Flexible] children, and reports this by drawing a red warning box on the
/// edge that is overflowing.
///
/// #### Story time
///
/// Suppose, for instance, that you had this code:
///
/// ```dart
/// new Row(
///   children: <Widget>[
///     const FlutterLogo(),
///     const Text('Flutter\'s hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bug faster. Experience sub-second reload times, without losing state, on emulators, simulators, and hardware for iOS and Android.'),
///     const Icon(Icons.sentiment_very_satisfied),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
///
/// The row first asks its first child, the [FlutterLogo], to lay out, at
/// whatever size the logo would like. The logo is friendly and happily decides
/// to be 24 pixels to a side. This leaves lots of room for the next child. The
/// row then asks that next child, the text, to lay out, at whatever size it
/// thinks is best.
///
/// At this point, the text, not knowing how wide is too wide, says "Ok, I will
/// be thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis wide.", and goes well beyond the space that the
/// row has available, not wrapping. The row responds, "That's not fair, now I
/// have no more room available for my other children!", and gets angry and
/// turns red.
///
/// The fix is to wrap the second child in an [Expanded] widget, which tells the
/// row that the child should be given the remaining room:
///
/// ```dart
/// new Row(
///   children: <Widget>[
///     const FlutterLogo(),
///     const Expanded(
///       child: const Text('Flutter\'s hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bug faster. Experience sub-second reload times, without losing state, on emulators, simulators, and hardware for iOS and Android.'),
///     ),
///     const Icon(Icons.sentiment_very_satisfied),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
///
/// Now, the row first asks the logo to lay out, and then asks the _icon_ to lay
/// out. The [Icon], like the logo, is happy to take on a reasonable size (also
/// 24 pixels, not coincidentally, since both [FlutterLogo] and [Icon] honor the
/// ambient [IconTheme]). This leaves some room left over, and now the row tells
/// the text exactly how wide to be: the exact width of the remaining space. The
/// text, now happy to comply to a reasonable request, wraps the text within
/// that width, and you end up with a paragraph split over several lines.
///
/// ## Layout algorithm
///
/// _This section describes how a [Row] is rendered by the framework._
///
/// Layout for a [Row] proceeds in six steps:
///
/// 1. Layout each child a null or zero flex factor (e.g., those that are not
///    [Expanded]) with unbounded horizontal constraints and the incoming
///    vertical constraints. If the [crossAxisAlignment] is
///    [CrossAxisAlignment.stretch], instead use tight vertical constraints that
///    match the incoming max height.
/// 2. Divide the remaining horizontal space among the children with non-zero
///    flex factors (e.g., those that are [Expanded]) according to their flex
///    factor. For example, a child with a flex factor of 2.0 will receive twice
///    the amount of horizontal space as a child with a flex factor of 1.0.
/// 3. Layout each of the remaining children with the same vertical constraints
///    as in step 1, but instead of using unbounded horizontal constraints, use
///    horizontal constraints based on the amount of space allocated in step 2.
///    Children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are [FlexFit.tight] are
///    given tight constraints (i.e., forced to fill the allocated space), and
///    children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are [FlexFit.loose] are
///    given loose constraints (i.e., not forced to fill the allocated space).
/// 4. The height of the [Row] is the maximum height of the children (which will
///    always satisfy the incoming vertical constraints).
/// 5. The width of the [Row] is determined by the [mainAxisSize] property. If
///    the [mainAxisSize] property is [MainAxisSize.max], then the width of the
///    [Row] is the max width of the incoming constraints. If the [mainAxisSize]
///    property is [MainAxisSize.min], then the width of the [Row] is the sum
///    of widths of the children (subject to the incoming constraints).
/// 6. Determine the position for each child according to the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] and the [crossAxisAlignment]. For example, if the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] is [MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween], any horizontal
///    space that has not been allocated to children is divided evenly and
///    placed between the children.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Column], for a vertical equivalent.
///  * [Flex], if you don't know in advance if you want a horizontal or vertical
///    arrangement.
///  * [Expanded], to indicate children that should take all the remaining room.
///  * [Flexible], to indicate children that should share the remaining room but
///    that may by sized smaller (leaving some remaining room unused).
class Row extends Flex {
  /// Creates a horizontal array of children.

///         child: const FlutterLogo(),
///       ),
///     ),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
///
/// In the sample above, the text and the logo are centered on each line. In the
/// following example, the [crossAxisAlignment] is set to
