/// A widget that manages a [FocusNode] to allow keyboard focus to be given
/// to this widget and its descendants.
///
/// When the focus is gained or lost, [onFocusChange] is called.
///
/// For keyboard events, [onKey] and [onKeyEvent] are called if
/// [FocusNode.hasFocus] is true for this widget's [focusNode], unless a focused
/// descendant's [onKey] or [onKeyEvent] callback returned
/// [KeyEventResult.handled] when called.
///
/// This widget does not provide any visual indication that the focus has
/// changed. Any desired visual changes should be made when [onFocusChange] is
/// called.
///
/// To access the [FocusNode] of the nearest ancestor [Focus] widget and
/// establish a relationship that will rebuild the widget when the focus
/// changes, use the [Focus.of] and [FocusScope.of] static methods.
///
/// To access the focused state of the nearest [Focus] widget, use
/// [FocusNode.hasFocus] from a build method, which also establishes a
/// relationship between the calling widget and the [Focus] widget that will
/// rebuild the calling widget when the focus changes.
///
/// Managing a [FocusNode] means managing its lifecycle, listening for changes
/// in focus, and re-parenting it when needed to keep the focus hierarchy in
/// sync with the widget hierarchy. This widget does all of those things for
/// you. See [FocusNode] for more information about the details of what node
/// management entails if you are not using a [Focus] widget and you need to do
/// it yourself.
///
/// If the [Focus] default constructor is used, then this widget will manage any
/// given [focusNode] by overwriting the appropriate values of the [focusNode]
/// with the values of [FocusNode.onKey], [FocusNode.onKeyEvent],
/// [FocusNode.skipTraversal], [FocusNode.canRequestFocus], and
/// [FocusNode.descendantsAreFocusable] whenever the [Focus] widget is updated.
///
/// If the [Focus.withExternalFocusNode] is used instead, then the values
/// returned by [onKey], [onKeyEvent], [skipTraversal], [canRequestFocus], and
/// [descendantsAreFocusable] will be the values in the external focus node, and
/// the external focus node's values will not be overwritten when the widget is
/// updated.
///
/// To collect a sub-tree of nodes into an exclusive group that restricts focus
/// traversal to the group, use a [FocusScope]. To collect a sub-tree of nodes
/// into a group that has a specific order to its traversal but allows the
/// traversal to escape the group, use a [FocusTraversalGroup].
///
/// To move the focus, use methods on [FocusNode] by getting the [FocusNode]
/// through the [of] method. For instance, to move the focus to the next node in
/// the focus traversal order, call `Focus.of(context).nextFocus()`. To unfocus
/// a widget, call `Focus.of(context).unfocus()`.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example shows how to manage focus using the [Focus] and [FocusScope]
/// widgets. See [FocusNode] for a similar example that doesn't use [Focus] or
/// [FocusScope].

/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example shows how to wrap another widget in a [Focus] widget to make it
/// focusable. It wraps a [Container], and changes the container's color when it
/// is set as the [FocusManager.primaryFocus].
///
/// If you also want to handle mouse hover and/or keyboard actions on a widget,
/// consider using a [FocusableActionDetector], which combines several different
/// widgets to provide those capabilities.

/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example shows how to focus a newly-created widget immediately after it

///
/// The focus node will not actually be given the focus until after the frame in

/// A [FocusScope] is similar to a [Focus], but also serves as a scope for its
/// descendants, restricting focus traversal to the scoped controls.
///
/// For example a new [FocusScope] is created automatically when a route is
/// pushed, keeping the focus traversal from moving to a control in a previous
/// route.
///
/// If you just want to group widgets together in a group so that they are
/// traversed in a particular order, but the focus can still leave the group,
/// use a [FocusTraversalGroup].
///
/// Like [Focus], [FocusScope] provides an [onFocusChange] as a way to be
/// notified when the focus is given to or removed from this widget.
///
/// The [onKey] argument allows specification of a key event handler that is
/// invoked when this node or one of its children has focus. Keys are handed to
/// the primary focused widget first, and then they propagate through the
/// ancestors of that node, stopping if one of them returns
/// [KeyEventResult.handled] from [onKey], indicating that it has handled the
/// event.
///
/// Managing a [FocusScopeNode] means managing its lifecycle, listening for
/// changes in focus, and re-parenting it when needed to keep the focus
/// hierarchy in sync with the widget hierarchy. This widget does all of those
/// things for you. See [FocusScopeNode] for more information about the details
/// of what node management entails if you are not using a [FocusScope] widget
/// and you need to do it yourself.
///
/// [FocusScopeNode]s remember the last [FocusNode] that was focused within
/// their descendants, and can move that focus to the next/previous node, or a
/// node in a particular direction when the [FocusNode.nextFocus],
/// [FocusNode.previousFocus], or [FocusNode.focusInDirection] are called on a
/// [FocusNode] or [FocusScopeNode].
///
/// To move the focus, use methods on [FocusNode] by getting the [FocusNode]
/// through the [of] method. For instance, to move the focus to the next node in
/// the focus traversal order, call `Focus.of(context).nextFocus()`. To unfocus
/// a widget, call `Focus.of(context).unfocus()`.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example demonstrates using a [FocusScope] to restrict focus to a particular
/// portion of the app. In this case, restricting focus to the visible part of a
/// Stack.
