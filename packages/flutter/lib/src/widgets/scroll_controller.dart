/// Controls a scrollable widget.
///
/// Scroll controllers are typically stored as member variables in [State]
/// objects and are reused in each [State.build]. A single scroll controller can
/// be used to control multiple scrollable widgets, but some operations, such
/// as reading the scroll [offset], require the controller to be used with a
/// single scrollable widget.
///
/// A scroll controller creates a [ScrollPosition] to manage the state specific
/// to an individual [Scrollable] widget. To use a custom [ScrollPosition],
/// subclass [ScrollController] and override [createScrollPosition].
///
/// A [ScrollController] is a [Listenable]. It notifies its listeners whenever
/// any of the attached [ScrollPosition]s notify _their_ listeners (i.e.
/// whenever any of them scroll). It does not notify its listeners when the list
/// of attached [ScrollPosition]s changes.
///
/// Typically used with [ListView], [GridView], [CustomScrollView].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ListView], [GridView], [CustomScrollView], which can be controlled by a
///    [ScrollController].
///  * [Scrollable], which is the lower-level widget that creates and associates
///    [ScrollPosition] objects with [ScrollController] objects.
///  * [PageController], which is an analogous object for controlling a
///    [PageView].
///  * [ScrollPosition], which manages the scroll offset for an individual
///    scrolling widget.
///  * [ScrollNotification] and [NotificationListener], which can be used to watch
///    the scroll position without using a [ScrollController].
