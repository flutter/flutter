/// required on this thread to produce each frame. The second shows how much
/// time was required on the raster thread (formerly known as the GPU thread)
/// to produce each frame. Ideally, both these values would be less than
/// the total frame budget for the hardware on which the app is running.
/// For example, if the hardware has a screen that updates at 60 Hz, each
/// thread should ideally spend less than 16ms producing each frame.
/// This ideal condition is indicated by a green vertical line for each thread.
/// Otherwise, the performance overlay shows a red vertical line.

/// [MaterialApp.showPerformanceOverlay] or [WidgetsApp.showPerformanceOverlay]
/// to true.
