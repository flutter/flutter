/// the scroll dimensions are allowed to happen (so as to prevent animations

/// [BouncingScrollPhysics] or [ClampingScrollPhysics], to obtain a complete

///
/// ## Implementation details
///
/// Specifically, these physics perform two adjustments.
///
/// The first is to maintain overscroll when the position is out of range.
///
/// The second is to enforce the boundary when the position is in range.
///
/// If the current velocity is non-zero, neither adjustment is made. The
/// assumption is that there is an ongoing animation and therefore
/// further changing the scroll position would disrupt the experience.
///
/// If the extents haven't changed, then the overscroll adjustment is
/// not made. The assumption is that if the position is overscrolled,
/// it is intentional, otherwise the position could not have reached
/// that position. (Consider [ClampingScrollPhysics] vs
/// [BouncingScrollPhysics] for example.)
///
/// If the position itself changed since the last animation frame,
/// then the overscroll is not maintained. The assumption is similar
/// to the previous case: the position would not have been placed out
/// of range unless it was intentional.
///
/// In addition, if the position changed and the boundaries were and
/// still are finite, then the boundary isn't enforced either, for
/// the same reason. However, if any of the boundaries were or are
/// now infinite, the boundary _is_ enforced, on the assumption that
/// infinite boundaries indicate a lazy-loading scroll view, which
/// cannot enforce boundaries while the full list has not loaded.
///
/// If the range was out of range, then the boundary is not enforced
/// even if the range is not maintained. If the range is maintained,
/// then the distance between the old position and the old boundary is
/// applied to the new boundary to obtain the new position.
///
/// If the range was in range, and the boundary is to be enforced,
/// then the new position is obtained by deferring to the other physics,
/// if any, and then clamped to the new range.
