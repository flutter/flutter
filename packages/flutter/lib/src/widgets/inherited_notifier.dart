/// An inherited widget for a [Listenable] [notifier], which updates its
/// dependencies when the [notifier] is triggered.
///
/// This is a variant of [InheritedWidget], specialized for subclasses of
/// [Listenable], such as [ChangeNotifier] or [ValueNotifier].
///
/// Dependents are notified whenever the [notifier] sends notifications, or
/// whenever the identity of the [notifier] changes.
///
/// Multiple notifications are coalesced, so that dependents only rebuild once
/// even if the [notifier] fires multiple times between two frames.
///
/// Typically this class is subclassed with a class that provides an `of` static
/// method that calls [BuildContext.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType] with that
/// class.
///
/// The [updateShouldNotify] method may also be overridden, to change the logic
/// in the cases where [notifier] itself is changed. The [updateShouldNotify]
/// method is called with the old [notifier] in the case of the [notifier] being
/// changed. When it returns true, the dependents are marked as needing to be
/// rebuilt this frame.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example shows three spinning squares that use the value of the notifier
/// on an ancestor [InheritedNotifier] (`SpinModel`) to give them their
/// rotation. The [InheritedNotifier] doesn't need to know about the children,
/// and the `notifier` argument doesn't need to be an animation controller, it
/// can be anything that implements [Listenable] (like a [ChangeNotifier]).
///
/// The `SpinModel` class could just as easily listen to another object (say, a
/// separate object that keeps the value of an input or data model value) that
/// is a [Listenable], and get the value from that. The descendants also don't
/// need to have an instance of the [InheritedNotifier] in order to use it, they
/// just need to know that there is one in their ancestry. This can help with
/// decoupling widgets from their models.
///

///  * [Animation], an implementation of [Listenable] that ticks each frame to
///    update a value.
///  * [ViewportOffset] or its subclass [ScrollPosition], implementations of

///  * [InheritedWidget], an inherited widget that only notifies dependents
///    when its value is different.
///  * [InheritedModel], an inherited widget that allows clients to subscribe
///    to changes for subparts of the value.
