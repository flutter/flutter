          //    information, but it may or may not get applied this frame,
          //    depending on whether said child is in the same layout scope.

          //    callback. Either way it is far too late for us to make our
          //    parent lay out again this frame, so the garbage won't get
          //    collected this frame.

/// The [handle] should be triggered any time the sending widget is removed from

/// [SliverGrid] (and [GridView]) widgets.

/// Failure to trigger the [handle] in the manner described above will likely
/// cause the [AutomaticKeepAlive] to lose track of whether the widget should be

/// garbage collected while it wants to be kept alive.
