// * OverlayEntry Implementation

/// A place in an [Overlay] that can contain a widget.
///
/// Overlay entries are inserted into an [Overlay] using the
/// [OverlayState.insert] or [OverlayState.insertAll] functions. To find the
/// closest enclosing overlay for a given [BuildContext], use the [Overlay.of]
/// function.
///
/// An overlay entry can be in at most one overlay at a time. To remove an entry
/// from its overlay, call the [remove] function on the overlay entry.
///
/// Because an [Overlay] uses a [Stack] layout, overlay entries can use
/// [Positioned] and [AnimatedPositioned] to position themselves within the
/// overlay.
///
/// For example, [Draggable] uses an [OverlayEntry] to show the drag avatar that
/// follows the user's finger across the screen after the drag begins. Using the
/// overlay to display the drag avatar lets the avatar float over the other
/// widgets in the app. As the user's finger moves, draggable calls
/// [markNeedsBuild] on the overlay entry to cause it to rebuild. In its build,
/// the entry includes a [Positioned] with its top and left property set to
/// position the drag avatar near the user's finger. When the drag is over,
/// [Draggable] removes the entry from the overlay to remove the drag avatar
/// from view.
///
/// By default, if there is an entirely [opaque] entry over this one, then this
/// one will not be included in the widget tree (in particular, stateful widgets
/// within the overlay entry will not be instantiated). To ensure that your
/// overlay entry is still built even if it is not visible, set [maintainState]
/// to true. This is more expensive, so should be done with care. In particular,
/// if widgets in an overlay entry with [maintainState] set to true repeatedly
/// call [State.setState], the user's battery will be drained unnecessarily.
///
/// [OverlayEntry] is a [Listenable] that notifies when the widget built by
/// [builder] is mounted or unmounted, whose exact state can be queried by
/// [mounted]. After the owner of the [OverlayEntry] calls [remove] and then
/// [dispose], the widget may not be immediately removed from the widget tree.
/// As a result listeners of the [OverlayEntry] can get notified for one last
/// time after the [dispose] call, when the widget is eventually unmounted.
///
/// {@macro flutter.widgets.overlayPortalVsOverlayEntry}

// * OverlayPortal Implementation
//  OverlayPortal is inspired by the
//  [flutter_portal](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_portal) package.
//
// ** RenderObject hierarchy
// The widget works by inserting its overlay child's render subtree directly
// under [Overlay]'s render object (_RenderTheater).
// https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31859944/171971838-62ed3975-4b5d-4733-a9c9-f79e263b8fcc.jpg
//
// To ensure the overlay child render subtree does not do layout twice, the
// subtree must only perform layout after both its _RenderTheater and the
// [OverlayPortal]'s render object (_RenderLayoutSurrogateProxyBox) have
// finished layout. This is handled by _RenderDeferredLayoutBox.
//
// ** Z-Index of an overlay child
// [_OverlayEntryLocation] is a (currently private) interface that allows an
// [OverlayPortal] to insert its overlay child into a specific [Overlay], as
// well as specifying the paint order between the overlay child and other
// children of the _RenderTheater.
//
// Since [OverlayPortal] is only allowed to target ancestor [Overlay]s
// (_RenderTheater must finish doing layout before _RenderDeferredLayoutBox),
// the _RenderTheater should typically be acquired using an [InheritedWidget]
// (currently, _RenderTheaterMarker) in case the [OverlayPortal] gets
// reparented.

/// A widget that renders its overlay child on an [Overlay].
///
/// The overlay child is initially hidden until [OverlayPortalController.show]
/// is called on the associated [controller]. The [OverlayPortal] uses
/// [overlayChildBuilder] to build its overlay child and renders it on the
/// specified [Overlay] as if it was inserted using an [OverlayEntry], while it
/// can depend on the same set of [InheritedWidget]s (such as [Theme]) that this
/// widget can depend on.
///
/// This widget requires an [Overlay] ancestor in the widget tree when its
/// overlay child is showing. The overlay child is rendered by the [Overlay]
/// ancestor, not by the widget itself. This allows the overlay child to float
/// above other widgets, independent of its position in the widget tree.
///
/// When [OverlayPortalController.hide] is called, the widget built using
/// [overlayChildBuilder] will be removed from the widget tree the next time the
/// widget rebuilds. Stateful descendants in the overlay child subtree may lose
/// states as a result.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example uses an [OverlayPortal] to build a tooltip that becomes visible
/// when the user taps on the [child] widget. There's a [DefaultTextStyle] above
/// the [OverlayPortal] controlling the [TextStyle] of both the [child] widget
/// and the widget [overlayChildBuilder] builds, which isn't otherwise doable if
/// the tooltip was added as an [OverlayEntry].
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/overlay/overlay_portal.0.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ### Paint Order
///
/// In an [Overlay], an overlay child is painted after the [OverlayEntry]
/// associated with its [OverlayPortal] (that is, the [OverlayEntry] closest to
/// the [OverlayPortal] in the widget tree, which usually represents the
/// enclosing [Route]), and before the next [OverlayEntry].
///
/// When an [OverlayEntry] has multiple associated [OverlayPortal]s, the paint
/// order between their overlay children is the order in which
/// [OverlayPortalController.show] was called. The last [OverlayPortal] to have
/// called `show` gets to paint its overlay child in the foreground.
///
/// ### Semantics
///
/// The semantics subtree generated by the overlay child is considered attached
/// to [OverlayPortal] instead of the target [Overlay]. An [OverlayPortal]'s
/// semantics subtree can be dropped from the semantics tree due to invisibility
/// while the overlay child is still visible (for example, when the
/// [OverlayPortal] is completely invisible in a [ListView] but kept alive by
/// a [KeepAlive] widget). When this happens the semantics subtree generated by
/// the overlay child is also dropped, even if the overlay child is still visible
/// on screen.
///
/// {@template flutter.widgets.overlayPortalVsOverlayEntry}
/// ### Differences between [OverlayPortal] and [OverlayEntry]
///
/// The main difference between [OverlayEntry] and [OverlayPortal] is that
/// [OverlayEntry] builds its widget subtree as a child of the target [Overlay],
/// while [OverlayPortal] uses [OverlayPortal.overlayChildBuilder] to build a
/// child widget of itself. This allows [OverlayPortal]'s overlay child to depend
/// on the same set of [InheritedWidget]s as [OverlayPortal], and it's also
/// guaranteed that the overlay child will not outlive its [OverlayPortal].
///
/// On the other hand, [OverlayPortal]'s implementation is more complex. For
/// instance, it does a bit more work than a regular widget during global key
/// reparenting. If the content to be shown on the [Overlay] doesn't benefit
/// from being a part of [OverlayPortal]'s subtree, consider using an
/// [OverlayEntry] instead.
/// {@endtemplate}
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [OverlayEntry], an alternative API for inserting widgets into an
///    [Overlay].
///  * [Positioned], which can be used to size and position the overlay child in
///    relation to the target [Overlay]'s boundaries.
///  * [CompositedTransformFollower], which can be used to position the overlay
///    child in relation to the linked [CompositedTransformTarget] widget.

//    called from within `layout` to schedule a layout update for this relayout
//    boundary when needed.

// 3. When invoked from `PipelineOwner.flushLayout`, or
//    `_layoutSurrogate.performLayout`, this `RenderObject` behaves like an
//    `Overlay` that has only one entry.
