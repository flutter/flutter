/// A piece of routing information.
///
/// The route information consists of a location string of the application and
/// a state object that configures the application in that location.
///
/// This information flows two ways, from the [RouteInformationProvider] to the
/// [Router] or from the [Router] to [RouteInformationProvider].
///
/// In the former case, the [RouteInformationProvider] notifies the [Router]
/// widget when a new [RouteInformation] is available. The [Router] widget takes
/// these information and navigates accordingly.
///
/// The latter case happens in web application where the [Router] reports route
/// changes back to the web engine.
///
/// The current [RouteInformation] of an application is also used for state
/// restoration purposes. Before an application is killed, the [Router] converts
/// its current configurations into a [RouteInformation] object utilizing the
/// [RouteInformationProvider]. The [RouteInformation] object is then serialized
/// out and persisted. During state restoration, the object is deserialized and
/// passed back to the [RouteInformationProvider], which turns it into a
/// configuration for the [Router] again to restore its state from.
class RouteInformation {
  /// Creates a route information object.
  ///
  /// The arguments may be null.
  const RouteInformation({this.location, this.state});

  /// The location of the application.
  ///
  /// The string is usually in the format of multiple string identifiers with
  /// slashes in between. ex: `/`, `/path`, `/path/to/the/app`.
  ///
  /// It is equivalent to the URL in a web application.
  final String? location;

  /// The state of the application in the [location].
  ///
  /// The app can have different states even in the same location. For example,
  /// the text inside a [TextField] or the scroll position in a [ScrollView].
  /// These widget states can be stored in the [state].
  ///
  /// On the web, this information is stored in the browser history when the
  /// [Router] reports this route information back to the web engine
  /// through the [PlatformRouteInformationProvider]. The information
  /// is then passed back, along with the [location], when the user
  /// clicks the back or forward buttons.
  ///
  /// This information is also serialized and persisted alongside the
  /// [location] for state restoration purposes. During state restoration,
  /// the information is made available again to the [Router] so it can restore
  /// its configuration to the previous state.
  ///
  /// The state must be serializable.
  final Object? state;
}

/// The dispatcher for opening and closing pages of an application.
///
/// This widget listens for routing information from the operating system (e.g.
/// an initial route provided on app startup, a new route obtained when an
/// intent is received, or a notification that the user hit the system back
/// button), parses route information into data of type `T`, and then converts
/// that data into [Page] objects that it passes to a [Navigator].
///
/// Each part of this process can be overridden and configured as desired.
///
/// The [routeInformationProvider] can be overridden to change how the name of
/// the route is obtained. The [RouteInformationProvider.value] is used as the
/// initial route when the [Router] is first created. Subsequent notifications
/// from the [RouteInformationProvider] to its listeners are treated as
/// notifications that the route information has changed.
///
/// The [backButtonDispatcher] can be overridden to change how back button
/// notifications are received. This must be a [BackButtonDispatcher], which is
/// an object where callbacks can be registered, and which can be chained so
/// that back button presses are delegated to subsidiary routers. The callbacks
/// are invoked to indicate that the user is trying to close the current route
/// (by pressing the system back button); the [Router] ensures that when this
/// callback is invoked, the message is passed to the [routerDelegate] and its
/// result is provided back to the [backButtonDispatcher]. Some platforms don't
/// have back buttons (e.g. iOS and desktop platforms); on those platforms this
/// notification is never sent. Typically, the [backButtonDispatcher] for the
/// root router is an instance of [RootBackButtonDispatcher], which uses a
/// [WidgetsBindingObserver] to listen to the `popRoute` notifications from
/// [SystemChannels.navigation]. Nested [Router]s typically use a
/// [ChildBackButtonDispatcher], which must be provided the
/// [BackButtonDispatcher] of its ancestor [Router] (available via [Router.of]).
///
/// The [routeInformationParser] can be overridden to change how names obtained
/// from the [routeInformationProvider] are interpreted. It must implement the
/// [RouteInformationParser] interface, specialized with the same type as the
/// [Router] itself. This type, `T`, represents the data type that the
/// [routeInformationParser] will generate.
///
/// The [routerDelegate] can be overridden to change how the output of the
/// [routeInformationParser] is interpreted. It must implement the
/// [RouterDelegate] interface, also specialized with `T`; it takes as input
/// the data (of type `T`) from the [routeInformationParser], and is responsible
/// for providing a navigating widget to insert into the widget tree. The
/// [RouterDelegate] interface is also [Listenable]; notifications are taken
/// to mean that the [Router] needs to rebuild.
///
/// ## Concerns regarding asynchrony
///
/// Some of the APIs (notably those involving [RouteInformationParser] and
/// [RouterDelegate]) are asynchronous.
///
/// When developing objects implementing these APIs, if the work can be done
/// entirely synchronously, then consider using [SynchronousFuture] for the
/// future returned from the relevant methods. This will allow the [Router] to
/// proceed in a completely synchronous way, which removes a number of
/// complications.
///
/// Using asynchronous computation is entirely reasonable, however, and the API
/// is designed to support it. For example, maybe a set of images need to be
/// loaded before a route can be shown; waiting for those images to be loaded
/// before [RouterDelegate.setNewRoutePath] returns is a reasonable approach to
/// handle this case.
///
/// If an asynchronous operation is ongoing when a new one is to be started, the
/// precise behavior will depend on the exact circumstances, as follows:
///
/// If the active operation is a [routeInformationParser] parsing a new route information:
/// that operation's result, if it ever completes, will be discarded.
///
/// If the active operation is a [routerDelegate] handling a pop request:
/// the previous pop is immediately completed with "false", claiming that the
/// previous pop was not handled (this may cause the application to close).
///
/// If the active operation is a [routerDelegate] handling an initial route
/// or a pushed route, the result depends on the new operation. If the new
/// operation is a pop request, then the original operation's result, if it ever
/// completes, will be discarded. If the new operation is a push request,
/// however, the [routeInformationParser] will be requested to start the parsing, and
/// only if that finishes before the original [routerDelegate] request
/// completes will that original request's result be discarded.
///
/// If the identity of the [Router] widget's delegates change while an
/// asynchronous operation is in progress, to keep matters simple, all active
/// asynchronous operations will have their results discarded. It is generally
/// considered unusual for these delegates to change during the lifetime of the
/// [Router].
///
/// If the [Router] itself is disposed while an asynchronous operation is in
/// progress, all active asynchronous operations will have their results
/// discarded also.
///
/// No explicit signals are provided to the [routeInformationParser] or
/// [routerDelegate] to indicate when any of the above happens, so it is
/// strongly recommended that [RouteInformationParser] and [RouterDelegate]
/// implementations not perform extensive computation.
///
/// ## Application architectural design
///
/// An application can have zero, one, or many [Router] widgets, depending on
/// its needs.
///
/// An application might have no [Router] widgets if it has only one "screen",
/// or if the facilities provided by [Navigator] are sufficient. This is common
/// for desktop applications, where subsidiary "screens" are represented using
/// different windows rather than changing the active interface.
///
/// A particularly elaborate application might have multiple [Router] widgets,
/// in a tree configuration, with the first handling the entire route parsing
/// and making the result available for routers in the subtree. The routers in
/// the subtree do not participate in route information parsing but merely take the
/// result from the first router to build their sub routes.
///
/// Most applications only need a single [Router].
///
/// ## URL updates for web applications
///
/// In the web platform, keeping the URL in the browser's location bar up to
/// date with the application state ensures that the browser constructs its
/// history entry correctly, allowing its back and forward buttons to function
/// as the user expects.
///
/// If an app state change leads to the [Router] rebuilding, the [Router] will
/// retrieve the new route information from the [routerDelegate]'s
/// [RouterDelegate.currentConfiguration] method and the
/// [routeInformationParser]'s [RouteInformationParser.restoreRouteInformation]
/// method.
///
/// If the location in the new route information is different from the
/// current location, this is considered to be a navigation event, the
/// [PlatformRouteInformationProvider.routerReportsNewRouteInformation] method
/// calls [SystemNavigator.routeInformationUpdated] with `replace = false` to
/// notify the engine, and through that the browser, to create a history entry
/// with the new url. Otherwise,
/// [PlatformRouteInformationProvider.routerReportsNewRouteInformation] calls
/// [SystemNavigator.routeInformationUpdated] with `replace = true` to update
/// the current history entry with the latest [RouteInformation].
///
/// One can force the [Router] to report new route information as navigation
/// event to the [routeInformationProvider] (and thus the browser) even if the
/// [RouteInformation.location] has not changed by calling the [Router.navigate]
/// method with a callback that performs the state change. This causes [Router]
/// to call the [RouteInformationProvider.routerReportsNewRouteInformation] with
/// [RouteInformationReportingType.navigate], and thus causes
/// [PlatformRouteInformationProvider] to push a new history entry regardlessly.
/// This allows one to support the browser's back and forward buttons without
/// changing the URL. For example, the scroll position of a scroll view may be
/// saved in the [RouteInformation.state]. Using [Router.navigate] to update the
/// scroll position causes the browser to create a new history entry with the
/// [RouteInformation.state] that stores this new scroll position. When the user
/// clicks the back button, the app will go back to the previous scroll position
/// without changing the URL in the location bar.
///
/// One can also force the [Router] to ignore a navigation event by making
/// those changes during a callback passed to [Router.neglect]. The [Router]
/// calls the [RouteInformationProvider.routerReportsNewRouteInformation] with
/// [RouteInformationReportingType.neglect], and thus causes
/// [PlatformRouteInformationProvider] to replace the current history entry
/// regardlessly even if it detects location change.
///
/// To opt out of URL updates entirely, pass null for [routeInformationProvider]
/// and [routeInformationParser]. This is not recommended in general, but may be
/// appropriate in the following cases:
///
/// * The application does not target the web platform.
///
/// * There are multiple router widgets in the application. Only one [Router]
///   widget should update the URL (typically the top-most one created by the
///   [WidgetsApp.router], [MaterialApp.router], or [CupertinoApp.router]).
///
/// * The application does not need to implement in-app navigation using the
///   browser's back and forward buttons.
///
/// In other cases, it is strongly recommended to implement the
/// [RouterDelegate.currentConfiguration] and
/// [RouteInformationParser.restoreRouteInformation] APIs to provide an optimal
/// user experience when running on the web platform.
///
/// ## State Restoration
///
/// The [Router] will restore the current configuration of the [routerDelegate]
/// during state restoration if it is configured with a [restorationScopeId] and
/// state restoration is enabled for the subtree. For that, the value of
/// [RouterDelegate.currentConfiguration] is serialized and persisted before the
/// app is killed by the operating system. After the app is restarted, the value
/// is deserialized and passed back to the [RouterDelegate] via a call to
/// [RouterDelegate.setRestoredRoutePath] (which by default just calls
/// [RouterDelegate.setNewRoutePath]). It is the responsibility of the
/// [RouterDelegate] to use the configuration information provided to restore
/// its internal state.
///
/// To serialize [RouterDelegate.currentConfiguration] and to deserialize it
/// again, the [Router] calls [RouteInformationParser.restoreRouteInformation]
/// and [RouteInformationParser.parseRouteInformation], respectively. Therefore,
/// if a [restorationScopeId] is provided, a [routeInformationParser] must be
/// configured as well.
