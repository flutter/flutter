/// A mixin class that provides an implementation for finding a node in a

///
/// This can be mixed in to other [FocusTraversalPolicy] implementations that
/// only want to implement new next/previous policies.
///
/// Since hysteresis in the navigation order is undesirable, this implementation
/// maintains a stack of previous locations that have been visited on the policy
/// data for the affected [FocusScopeNode]. If the previous direction was the
/// opposite of the current direction, then the this policy will request focus
/// on the previously focused node. Change to another direction other than the
/// current one or its opposite will clear the stack.
///
/// For instance, if the focus moves down, down, down, and then up, up, up, it
/// will follow the same path through the widgets in both directions. However,
/// if it moves down, down, down, left, right, and then up, up, up, it may not
/// follow the same path on the way up as it did on the way down, since changing
/// the axis of motion resets the history.
///
/// This class implements an algorithm that considers an infinite band extending
/// along the direction of movement, the width or height (depending on
/// direction) of the currently focused widget, and finds the closest widget in
/// that band along the direction of movement. If nothing is found in that band,
/// then it picks the widget with an edge closest to the band in the
/// perpendicular direction. If two out-of-band widgets are the same distance
/// from the band, then it picks the one closest along the direction of
/// movement.
///
/// The goal of this algorithm is to pick a widget that (to the user) doesn't
/// appear to traverse along the wrong axis, as it might if it only sorted
/// widgets by distance along one axis, but also jumps to the next logical
/// widget in a direction without skipping over widgets.
///
/// See also:
///
/// * [FocusNode], for a description of the focus system.
/// * [FocusTraversalGroup], a widget that groups together and imposes a
///   traversal policy on the [Focus] nodes below it in the widget hierarchy.
/// * [WidgetOrderTraversalPolicy], a policy that relies on the widget creation
///   order to describe the order of traversal.
/// * [ReadingOrderTraversalPolicy], a policy that describes the order as the
///   natural "reading order" for the current [Directionality].
/// * [OrderedTraversalPolicy], a policy that describes the order explicitly
