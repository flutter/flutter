/// is transitioning in.
///
/// If the "new" child is the same widget type and key as the "old" child, but
/// with different parameters, then [AnimatedSwitcher] will *not* do a
/// transition between them, since as far as the framework is concerned, they
/// are the same widget and the existing widget can be updated with the new
/// parameters. To force the transition to occur, set a [Key] on each child
/// widget that you wish to be considered unique (typically a [ValueKey] on the
/// widget data that distinguishes this child from the others).
///
/// The same key can be used for a new child as was used for an already-outgoing
/// child; the two will not be considered related. (For example, if a progress
/// indicator with key A is first shown, then an image with key B, then another
/// progress indicator with key A again, all in rapid succession, then the old
/// progress indicator and the image will be fading out while a new progress
/// indicator is fading in.)
