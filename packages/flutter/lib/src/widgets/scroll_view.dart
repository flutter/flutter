/// ## Accessibility
///
/// A [CustomScrollView] can allow Talkback/VoiceOver to make announcements
/// to the user when the scroll state changes. For example, on Android an
/// announcement might be read as "showing items 1 to 10 of 23". To produce
/// this announcement, the scroll view needs three pieces of information:
///
///   * The first visible child index.
///   * The total number of children.
///   * The total number of visible children.
///
/// The last value can be computed exactly by the framework, however the first
/// two must be provided. Most of the higher-level scrollable widgets provide
/// this information automatically. For example, [ListView] provides each child
/// widget with a semantic index automatically and sets the semantic child
/// count to the length of the list.
///
/// To determine visible indexes, the scroll view needs a way to associate the
/// generated semantics of each scrollable item with a semantic index. This can
/// be done by wrapping the child widgets in an [IndexedSemantics].
///
/// This semantic index is not necessarily the same as the index of the widget in
/// the scrollable, because some widgets may not contribute semantic
/// information. Consider a [ListView.separated]: every other widget is a
/// divider with no semantic information. In this case, only odd numbered
/// widgets have a semantic index (equal to the index ~/ 2). Furthermore, the
/// total number of children in this example would be half the number of
/// widgets. (The [ListView.separated] constructor handles this
/// automatically; this is only used here as an example.)
///
/// The total number of visible children can be provided by the constructor
/// parameter `semanticChildCount`. This should always be the same as the
/// number of widgets wrapped in [IndexedSemantics].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [SliverList], which is a sliver that displays linear list of children.
///  * [SliverFixedExtentList], which is a more efficient sliver that displays
///    linear list of children that have the same extent along the scroll axis.
///  * [SliverGrid], which is a sliver that displays a 2D array of children.
///  * [SliverPadding], which is a sliver that adds blank space around another
///    sliver.
///  * [SliverAppBar], which is a sliver that displays a header that can expand
///    and float as the scroll view scrolls.
///  * [ScrollNotification] and [NotificationListener], which can be used to watch
///    the scroll position without using a [ScrollController].
///  * [IndexedSemantics], which allows annotating child lists with an index
///    for scroll announcements.

///
/// [ListView] is the most commonly used scrolling widget. It displays its
/// children one after another in the scroll direction. In the cross axis, the
/// children are required to fill the [ListView].
///
/// If non-null, the [itemExtent] forces the children to have the given extent
/// in the scroll direction. Specifying an [itemExtent] is more efficient than
/// letting the children determine their own extent because the scrolling
/// machinery can make use of the foreknowledge of the children's extent to save
/// work, for example when the scroll position changes drastically.
///
/// There are four options for constructing a [ListView]:
///
///  1. The default constructor takes an explicit [List<Widget>] of children. This
///     constructor is appropriate for list views with a small number of
///     children because constructing the [List] requires doing work for every
///     child that could possibly be displayed in the list view instead of just
///     those children that are actually visible.
///
///  2. The [ListView.builder] constructor takes an [IndexedWidgetBuilder], which
///     builds the children on demand. This constructor is appropriate for list views
///     with a large (or infinite) number of children because the builder is called
///     only for those children that are actually visible.
///
///  3. The [ListView.separated] constructor takes two [IndexedWidgetBuilder]s:
///     `itemBuilder` builds child items on demand, and `separatorBuilder`
///     similarly builds separator children which appear in between the child items.
///     This constructor is appropriate for list views with a fixed number of children.
///
///  4. The [ListView.custom] constructor takes a [SliverChildDelegate], which provides
///     the ability to customize additional aspects of the child model. For example,
///     a [SliverChildDelegate] can control the algorithm used to estimate the
///     size of children that are not actually visible.
///
/// To control the initial scroll offset of the scroll view, provide a
/// [controller] with its [ScrollController.initialScrollOffset] property set.
///
/// By default, [ListView] will automatically pad the list's scrollable
/// extremities to avoid partial obstructions indicated by [MediaQuery]'s
/// padding. To avoid this behavior, override with a zero [padding] property.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// This example uses the default constructor for [ListView] which takes an

///
/// ## Child elements' lifecycle
///
/// ### Creation
///
/// While laying out the list, visible children's elements, states and render
/// objects will be created lazily based on existing widgets (such as when using
/// the default constructor) or lazily provided ones (such as when using the
/// [ListView.builder] constructor).
///
/// ### Destruction
///
/// When a child is scrolled out of view, the associated element subtree,
/// states and render objects are destroyed. A new child at the same position
/// in the list will be lazily recreated along with new elements, states and
/// render objects when it is scrolled back.
///
/// ### Destruction mitigation
///
/// In order to preserve state as child elements are scrolled in and out of
/// view, the following options are possible:
///
///  * Moving the ownership of non-trivial UI-state-driving business logic
///    out of the list child subtree. For instance, if a list contains posts
///    with their number of upvotes coming from a cached network response, store
///    the list of posts and upvote number in a data model outside the list. Let
///    the list child UI subtree be easily recreate-able from the
///    source-of-truth model object. Use [StatefulWidget]s in the child
///    widget subtree to store instantaneous UI state only.
///
///  * Letting [KeepAlive] be the root widget of the list child widget subtree
///    that needs to be preserved. The [KeepAlive] widget marks the child
///    subtree's top render object child for keepalive. When the associated top
///    render object is scrolled out of view, the list keeps the child's render
///    object (and by extension, its associated elements and states) in a cache
///    list instead of destroying them. When scrolled back into view, the render
///    object is repainted as-is (if it wasn't marked dirty in the interim).
///
///    This only works if `addAutomaticKeepAlives` and `addRepaintBoundaries`
///    are false since those parameters cause the [ListView] to wrap each child
///    widget subtree with other widgets.
///
///  * Using [AutomaticKeepAlive] widgets (inserted by default when
///    `addAutomaticKeepAlives` is true). [AutomaticKeepAlive] allows descendant
///    widgets to control whether the subtree is actually kept alive or not.
///    This behavior is in contrast with [KeepAlive], which will unconditionally keep
///    the subtree alive.
///
///    As an example, the [EditableText] widget signals its list child element
///    subtree to stay alive while its text field has input focus. If it doesn't
///    have focus and no other descendants signaled for keepalive via a
///    [KeepAliveNotification], the list child element subtree will be destroyed
///    when scrolled away.
///
///    [AutomaticKeepAlive] descendants typically signal it to be kept alive
///    by using the [AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin], then implementing the
///    [AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin.wantKeepAlive] getter and calling
///    [AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin.updateKeepAlive].
///
/// ## Transitioning to [CustomScrollView]
///
/// A [ListView] is basically a [CustomScrollView] with a single [SliverList] in
/// its [CustomScrollView.slivers] property.
///
/// If [ListView] is no longer sufficient, for example because the scroll view
/// is to have both a list and a grid, or because the list is to be combined
/// with a [SliverAppBar], etc, it is straight-forward to port code from using
/// [ListView] to using [CustomScrollView] directly.
///
/// The [key], [scrollDirection], [reverse], [controller], [primary], [physics],
/// and [shrinkWrap] properties on [ListView] map directly to the identically
/// named properties on [CustomScrollView].
///
/// The [CustomScrollView.slivers] property should be a list containing either a
/// [SliverList] or a [SliverFixedExtentList]; the former if [itemExtent] on the
/// [ListView] was null, and the latter if [itemExtent] was not null.
///
/// The [childrenDelegate] property on [ListView] corresponds to the
/// [SliverList.delegate] (or [SliverFixedExtentList.delegate]) property. The
/// [ListView] constructor's `children` argument corresponds to the
/// [childrenDelegate] being a [SliverChildListDelegate] with that same
/// argument. The [ListView.builder] constructor's `itemBuilder` and
/// `itemCount` arguments correspond to the [childrenDelegate] being a
/// [SliverChildBuilderDelegate] with the equivalent arguments.
///
/// The [padding] property corresponds to having a [SliverPadding] in the
/// [CustomScrollView.slivers] property instead of the list itself, and having
/// the [SliverList] instead be a child of the [SliverPadding].
///
/// [CustomScrollView]s don't automatically avoid obstructions from [MediaQuery]
/// like [ListView]s do. To reproduce the behavior, wrap the slivers in
/// [SliverSafeArea]s.
///
/// Once code has been ported to use [CustomScrollView], other slivers, such as
/// [SliverGrid] or [SliverAppBar], can be put in the [CustomScrollView.slivers]
/// list.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// Here are two brief snippets showing a [ListView] and its equivalent using
/// [CustomScrollView]:
///
/// ```dart
/// ListView(
///   shrinkWrap: true,
///   padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
///   children: const <Widget>[
///     Text("I'm dedicating every day to you"),
///     Text('Domestic life was never quite my style'),
///     Text('When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart'),
///     Text('And I thought I was so smart'),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// ```dart
/// CustomScrollView(
///   shrinkWrap: true,
///   slivers: <Widget>[
///     SliverPadding(
///       padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
///       sliver: SliverList(
///         delegate: SliverChildListDelegate(
///           <Widget>[
///             const Text("I'm dedicating every day to you"),
///             const Text('Domestic life was never quite my style'),
///             const Text('When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart'),
///             const Text('And I thought I was so smart'),
///           ],
///         ),
///       ),
///     ),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## Special handling for an empty list
///
/// A common design pattern is to have a custom UI for an empty list. The best
/// way to achieve this in Flutter is just conditionally replacing the
/// [ListView] at build time with whatever widgets you need to show for the
/// empty list state:
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// Example of simple empty list interface:
///
/// ```dart
/// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///   return Scaffold(
///     appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Empty List Test')),
///     body: itemCount > 0
///       ? ListView.builder(
///           itemCount: itemCount,
///           itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
///             return ListTile(
///               title: Text('Item ${index + 1}'),
///             );
///           },
///         )
///       : const Center(child: Text('No items')),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## Selection of list items
///
/// `ListView` has no built-in notion of a selected item or items. For a small
/// example of how a caller might wire up basic item selection, see
/// [ListTile.selected].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [SingleChildScrollView], which is a scrollable widget that has a single
///    child.
///  * [PageView], which is a scrolling list of child widgets that are each the
///    size of the viewport.
///  * [GridView], which is a scrollable, 2D array of widgets.
///  * [CustomScrollView], which is a scrollable widget that creates custom
///    scroll effects using slivers.
///  * [ListBody], which arranges its children in a similar manner, but without
///    scrolling.
///  * [ScrollNotification] and [NotificationListener], which can be used to watch
///    the scroll position without using a [ScrollController].

/// [GridView.extent], which creates a layout with tiles that have a maximum
/// cross-axis extent. A custom [SliverGridDelegate] can produce an arbitrary 2D
/// arrangement of children, including arrangements that are unaligned or
/// overlapping.
///
/// To create a grid with a large (or infinite) number of children, use the
/// [GridView.builder] constructor with either a
/// [SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount] or a
/// [SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent] for the [gridDelegate].
///
/// To use a custom [SliverChildDelegate], use [GridView.custom].

///
/// ## Transitioning to [CustomScrollView]
///
/// A [GridView] is basically a [CustomScrollView] with a single [SliverGrid] in
/// its [CustomScrollView.slivers] property.
///
/// If [GridView] is no longer sufficient, for example because the scroll view
/// is to have both a grid and a list, or because the grid is to be combined
/// with a [SliverAppBar], etc, it is straight-forward to port code from using
/// [GridView] to using [CustomScrollView] directly.
///
/// The [key], [scrollDirection], [reverse], [controller], [primary], [physics],
/// and [shrinkWrap] properties on [GridView] map directly to the identically
/// named properties on [CustomScrollView].
///
/// The [CustomScrollView.slivers] property should be a list containing just a
/// [SliverGrid].
///
/// The [childrenDelegate] property on [GridView] corresponds to the
/// [SliverGrid.delegate] property, and the [gridDelegate] property on the
/// [GridView] corresponds to the [SliverGrid.gridDelegate] property.
///
/// The [GridView], [GridView.count], and [GridView.extent]
/// constructors' `children` arguments correspond to the [childrenDelegate]
/// being a [SliverChildListDelegate] with that same argument. The
/// [GridView.builder] constructor's `itemBuilder` and `childCount` arguments
/// correspond to the [childrenDelegate] being a [SliverChildBuilderDelegate]
/// with the matching arguments.
///
/// The [GridView.count] and [GridView.extent] constructors create
/// custom grid delegates, and have equivalently named constructors on
/// [SliverGrid] to ease the transition: [SliverGrid.count] and
/// [SliverGrid.extent] respectively.
///
/// The [padding] property corresponds to having a [SliverPadding] in the
/// [CustomScrollView.slivers] property instead of the grid itself, and having
/// the [SliverGrid] instead be a child of the [SliverPadding].
///
/// Once code has been ported to use [CustomScrollView], other slivers, such as
