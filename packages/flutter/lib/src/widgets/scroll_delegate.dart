/// A delegate that supplies children for slivers.
///
/// Many slivers lazily construct their box children to avoid creating more
/// children than are visible through the [Viewport]. Rather than receiving
/// their children as an explicit [List], they receive their children using a
/// [SliverChildDelegate].
///
/// It's uncommon to subclass [SliverChildDelegate]. Instead, consider using one
/// of the existing subclasses that provide adaptors to builder callbacks or
/// explicit child lists.
///
/// {@template flutter.widgets.SliverChildDelegate.lifecycle}
/// ## Child elements' lifecycle
///
/// ### Creation
///
/// While laying out the list, visible children's elements, states and render
/// objects will be created lazily based on existing widgets (such as in the
/// case of [SliverChildListDelegate]) or lazily provided ones (such as in the
/// case of [SliverChildBuilderDelegate]).
///
/// ### Destruction
///
/// When a child is scrolled out of view, the associated element subtree, states
/// and render objects are destroyed. A new child at the same position in the
/// sliver will be lazily recreated along with new elements, states and render
/// objects when it is scrolled back.
///
/// ### Destruction mitigation
///
/// In order to preserve state as child elements are scrolled in and out of
/// view, the following options are possible:
///
///  * Moving the ownership of non-trivial UI-state-driving business logic
///    out of the sliver child subtree. For instance, if a list contains posts
///    with their number of upvotes coming from a cached network response, store
///    the list of posts and upvote number in a data model outside the list. Let
///    the sliver child UI subtree be easily recreate-able from the
///    source-of-truth model object. Use [StatefulWidget]s in the child widget
///    subtree to store instantaneous UI state only.
///
///  * Letting [KeepAlive] be the root widget of the sliver child widget subtree
///    that needs to be preserved. The [KeepAlive] widget marks the child
///    subtree's top render object child for keepalive. When the associated top
///    render object is scrolled out of view, the sliver keeps the child's
///    render object (and by extension, its associated elements and states) in a
///    cache list instead of destroying them. When scrolled back into view, the
///    render object is repainted as-is (if it wasn't marked dirty in the
///    interim).
///
///    This only works if the [SliverChildDelegate] subclasses don't wrap the
///    child widget subtree with other widgets such as [AutomaticKeepAlive] and
///    [RepaintBoundary] via `addAutomaticKeepAlives` and
///    `addRepaintBoundaries`.
///
///  * Using [AutomaticKeepAlive] widgets (inserted by default in
///    [SliverChildListDelegate] or [SliverChildListDelegate]).
///    [AutomaticKeepAlive] allows descendant widgets to control whether the
///    subtree is actually kept alive or not. This behavior is in contrast with
///    [KeepAlive], which will unconditionally keep the subtree alive.
///
///    As an example, the [EditableText] widget signals its sliver child element
///    subtree to stay alive while its text field has input focus. If it doesn't
///    have focus and no other descendants signaled for keepalive via a
///    [KeepAliveNotification], the sliver child element subtree will be
///    destroyed when scrolled away.
///
///    [AutomaticKeepAlive] descendants typically signal it to be kept alive by
///    using the [AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin], then implementing the
///    [AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin.wantKeepAlive] getter and calling
///    [AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin.updateKeepAlive].
///
/// ## Using more than one delegate in a [Viewport]
///
/// If multiple delegates are used in a single scroll view, the first child of
/// each delegate will always be laid out, even if it extends beyond the
/// currently viewable area. This is because at least one child is required in
/// order to [estimateMaxScrollOffset] for the whole scroll view, as it uses the
/// currently built children to estimate the remaining children's extent.
/// {@endtemplate}
///
/// See also:

///    callback to construct the children.
///  * [SliverChildListDelegate], which is a delegate that has an explicit list
///    of children.
