/// Signature used by [NestedScrollView] for building its header.
///
/// The `innerBoxIsScrolled` argument is typically used to control the
/// [SliverAppBar.forceElevated] property to ensure that the app bar shows a
/// shadow, since it would otherwise not necessarily be aware that it had
/// content ostensibly below it.
typedef NestedScrollViewHeaderSliversBuilder = List<Widget> Function(BuildContext context, bool innerBoxIsScrolled);

/// A scrolling view inside of which can be nested other scrolling views, with
/// their scroll positions being intrinsically linked.
///
/// The most common use case for this widget is a scrollable view with a
/// flexible [SliverAppBar] containing a [TabBar] in the header (built by
/// [headerSliverBuilder]), and with a [TabBarView] in the [body], such that the
/// scrollable view's contents vary based on which tab is visible.
///
/// ## Motivation
///
/// In a normal [ScrollView], there is one set of slivers (the components of the
/// scrolling view). If one of those slivers hosted a [TabBarView] which scrolls
/// in the opposite direction (e.g. allowing the user to swipe horizontally
/// between the pages represented by the tabs, while the list scrolls
/// vertically), then any list inside that [TabBarView] would not interact with
/// the outer [ScrollView]. For example, flinging the inner list to scroll to
/// the top would not cause a collapsed [SliverAppBar] in the outer [ScrollView]
/// to expand.
///
/// [NestedScrollView] solves this problem by providing custom
/// [ScrollController]s for the outer [ScrollView] and the inner [ScrollView]s
/// (those inside the [TabBarView], hooking them together so that they appear,
/// to the user, as one coherent scroll view.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example shows a [NestedScrollView] whose header is the combination of a
/// [TabBar] in a [SliverAppBar] and whose body is a [TabBarView]. It uses a
/// [SliverOverlapAbsorber]/[SliverOverlapInjector] pair to make the inner lists
/// align correctly, and it uses [SafeArea] to avoid any horizontal disturbances
/// (e.g. the "notch" on iOS when the phone is horizontal). In addition,
/// [PageStorageKey]s are used to remember the scroll position of each tab's
/// list.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/nested_scroll_view/nested_scroll_view.0.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example shows how to keep the state of tabs using
/// [AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin] in [NestedScrollView]. By switching between
/// [ScrollController] and [PrimaryScrollController] based on the selected tab,
/// the scroll positions of the tabs can be made independent.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/nested_scroll_view/nested_scroll_view.3.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## [SliverAppBar]s with [NestedScrollView]s
///
/// Using a [SliverAppBar] in the outer scroll view, or [headerSliverBuilder],
/// of a [NestedScrollView] may require special configurations in order to work
/// as it would if the outer and inner were one single scroll view, like a
/// [CustomScrollView].
///
/// ### Pinned [SliverAppBar]s
///
/// A pinned [SliverAppBar] works in a [NestedScrollView] exactly as it would in
/// another scroll view, like [CustomScrollView]. When using
/// [SliverAppBar.pinned], the app bar remains visible at the top of the scroll
/// view. The app bar can still expand and contract as the user scrolls, but it
/// will remain visible rather than being scrolled out of view.
///
/// This works naturally in a [NestedScrollView], as the pinned [SliverAppBar]
/// is not expected to move in or out of the visible portion of the viewport.
/// As the inner or outer [Scrollable]s are moved, the app bar persists as
/// expected.
///
/// If the app bar is floating, pinned, and using an expanded height, follow the
/// floating convention laid out below.
///
/// ### Floating [SliverAppBar]s
///
/// When placed in the outer scrollable, or the [headerSliverBuilder],
/// a [SliverAppBar] that floats, using [SliverAppBar.floating] will not be
/// triggered to float over the inner scroll view, or [body], automatically.
///
/// This is because a floating app bar uses the scroll offset of its own
/// [Scrollable] to dictate the floating action. Being two separate inner and
/// outer [Scrollable]s, a [SliverAppBar] in the outer header is not aware of
/// changes in the scroll offset of the inner body.
///
/// In order to float the outer, use [NestedScrollView.floatHeaderSlivers]. When
/// set to true, the nested scrolling coordinator will prioritize floating in
/// the header slivers before applying the remaining drag to the body.
///
/// Furthermore, the `floatHeaderSlivers` flag should also be used when using an
/// app bar that is floating, pinned, and has an expanded height. In this
/// configuration, the flexible space of the app bar will open and collapse,
/// while the primary portion of the app bar remains pinned.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This simple example shows a [NestedScrollView] whose header contains a
/// floating [SliverAppBar]. By using the [floatHeaderSlivers] property, the
/// floating behavior is coordinated between the outer and inner [Scrollable]s,
/// so it behaves as it would in a single scrollable.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/nested_scroll_view/nested_scroll_view.1.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ### Snapping [SliverAppBar]s
///
/// Floating [SliverAppBar]s also have the option to perform a snapping animation.
/// If [SliverAppBar.snap] is true, then a scroll that exposes the floating app
/// bar will trigger an animation that slides the entire app bar into view.
/// Similarly if a scroll dismisses the app bar, the animation will slide the
/// app bar completely out of view.
///
/// It is possible with a [NestedScrollView] to perform just the snapping
/// animation without floating the app bar in and out. By not using the
/// [NestedScrollView.floatHeaderSlivers], the app bar will snap in and out
/// without floating.
///
/// The [SliverAppBar.snap] animation should be used in conjunction with the
/// [SliverOverlapAbsorber] and  [SliverOverlapInjector] widgets when
/// implemented in a [NestedScrollView]. These widgets take any overlapping
/// behavior of the [SliverAppBar] in the header and redirect it to the
/// [SliverOverlapInjector] in the body. If it is missing, then it is possible
/// for the nested "inner" scroll view below to end up under the [SliverAppBar]
/// even when the inner scroll view thinks it has not been scrolled.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This simple example shows a [NestedScrollView] whose header contains a
/// snapping, floating [SliverAppBar]. _Without_ setting any additional flags,
/// e.g [NestedScrollView.floatHeaderSlivers], the [SliverAppBar] will animate
/// in and out without floating. The [SliverOverlapAbsorber] and
/// [SliverOverlapInjector] maintain the proper alignment between the two
/// separate scroll views.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/nested_scroll_view/nested_scroll_view.2.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ### Snapping and Floating [SliverAppBar]s
///
// See https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/59189
/// Currently, [NestedScrollView] does not support simultaneously floating and
/// snapping the outer scrollable, e.g. when using [SliverAppBar.floating] &
/// [SliverAppBar.snap] at the same time.
///
/// ### Stretching [SliverAppBar]s
///
// See https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/54059
/// Currently, [NestedScrollView] does not support stretching the outer
/// scrollable, e.g. when using [SliverAppBar.stretch].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [SliverAppBar], for examples on different configurations like floating,
///    pinned and snap behaviors.
///  * [SliverOverlapAbsorber], a sliver that wraps another, forcing its layout
///    extent to be treated as overlap.
///  * [SliverOverlapInjector], a sliver that has a sliver geometry based on
///    the values stored in a [SliverOverlapAbsorberHandle].
