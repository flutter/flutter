///    factors according to their flex factor. For example, a child with a flex
///    factor of 2.0 will receive twice the amount of cross axis space as a child
///    with a flex factor 1.0.
/// 3. Layout each of the remaining children with the cross axis constraint
///    allocated in the previous step.

///    [SliverConstraints.remainingPaintExtent] minus to use as the child's
///    [SliverConstraints.remainingPaintExtent]. For the [SliverConstraints.scrollOffset],
///    take the provided constraint's value and subtract out the offset variable, using
///    0.0 if negative.
/// 3. Once we finish laying out all the slivers, this offset variable represents
///    the total [SliverGeometry.scrollExtent] of the sliver group. Since it is possible
///    for specialized slivers to try to paint itself outside of the bounds of the
///    sliver group's scroll extent (see [SliverPersistentHeader]), we must do a
///    second pass to set a [SliverPhysicalParentData.paintOffset] to make sure it
///    is within the bounds of the sliver group.
/// 4. Finally, set the [RenderSliverMainAxisGroup.geometry] with the total

///    the constraints and [SliverGeometry.scrollExtent], and [SliverGeometry.maxPaintExtent].
