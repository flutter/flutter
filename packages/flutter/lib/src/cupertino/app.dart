/// An application that uses Cupertino design.
///
/// A convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly
/// required for an iOS-design targeting application. It builds upon a
/// [WidgetsApp] by iOS specific defaulting such as fonts and scrolling
/// physics.
///
/// The [CupertinoApp] configures the top-level [Navigator] to search for routes
/// in the following order:
///
///  1. For the `/` route, the [home] property, if non-null, is used.
///
///  2. Otherwise, the [routes] table is used, if it has an entry for the route.
///
///  3. Otherwise, [onGenerateRoute] is called, if provided. It should return a
///     non-null value for any _valid_ route not handled by [home] and [routes].
///
///  4. Finally if all else fails [onUnknownRoute] is called.
///
/// If [home], [routes], [onGenerateRoute], and [onUnknownRoute] are all null,
/// and [builder] is not null, then no [Navigator] is created.
///
/// Using this widget with caution on Android since it may produce behaviors
/// Android users are not expecting such as:
///
///  * Pages will be dismissible via a back swipe.
///  * Scrolling past extremities will trigger iOS-style spring overscrolls.
///  * The San Francisco font family is unavailable on Android and can result
///    in undefined font behavior.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [CupertinoPageScaffold], which provides a standard page layout default
///    with nav bars.
///  * [Navigator], which is used to manage the app's stack of pages.
///  * [CupertinoPageRoute], which defines an app page that transitions in an
///    iOS-specific way.
///  * [WidgetsApp], which defines the basic app elements but does not depend
///    on the Cupertino library.
