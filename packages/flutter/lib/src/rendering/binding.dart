  ///
  /// 4. The compositing bits phase: The compositing bits on any dirty
  /// [RenderObject] objects are updated. See
  /// [RenderObject.markNeedsCompositingBitsUpdate].
  ///
  /// 5. The paint phase: All the dirty [RenderObject]s in the system are
  /// repainted (see [RenderObject.paint]). This generates the [Layer] tree. See
  /// [RenderObject.markNeedsPaint] for further details on marking an object
  /// dirty for paint.
  ///
  /// 6. The compositing phase: The layer tree is turned into a [Scene] and
  /// sent to the GPU.

  /// 7. The semantics phase: All the dirty [RenderObject]s in the system have
  /// their semantics updated. This generates the [SemanticsNode] tree. See

  /// object dirty for semantics.
  ///
