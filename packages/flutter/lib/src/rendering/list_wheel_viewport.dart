/// is in contrast to typical lists that start with the first scrollable item
/// at the start of the main axis and ends with the last scrollable item at the
/// end of the main axis.
///
/// Instead of rendering its children on a flat plane, it renders them
/// as if each child is broken into its own plane and that plane is
/// perpendicularly fixed onto a cylinder which rotates along the scrolling
/// axis.
///
/// This class works in 3 coordinate systems:
///
/// 1. The **scrollable layout coordinates**. This coordinate system is used to
///    communicate with [ViewportOffset] and describes its children's abstract
///    offset from the beginning of the scrollable list at (0.0, 0.0).
///
///    The list is scrollable from the start of the first child item to the
///    start of the last child item.
///
///    Children's layout coordinates don't change as the viewport scrolls.
///
/// 2. The **untransformed plane's viewport painting coordinates**. Children are
///    not painted in this coordinate system. It's an abstract intermediary used
///    before transforming into the next cylindrical coordinate system.
///
///    This system is the **scrollable layout coordinates** translated by the
///    scroll offset such that (0.0, 0.0) is the top left corner of the
///    viewport.
///
///    Because the viewport is centered at the scrollable list's scroll offset
///    instead of starting at the scroll offset, there are paintable children
///    ~1/2 viewport length before and after the scroll offset instead of ~1
///    viewport length after the scroll offset.
///
///    Children's visibility inclusion in the viewport is determined in this
///    system regardless of the cylinder's properties such as [diameterRatio]
///    or [perspective]. In other words, a 100px long viewport will always
///    paint 10-11 visible 10px children if there are enough children in the
///    viewport.
///
/// 3. The **transformed cylindrical space viewport painting coordinates**.
///    Children from system 2 get their positions transformed into a cylindrical
///    projection matrix instead of its Cartesian offset with respect to the
///    scroll offset.
///
///    Children in this coordinate system are painted.
///
///    The wheel's size and the maximum and minimum visible angles are both
///    controlled by [diameterRatio]. Children visible in the **untransformed
///    plane's viewport painting coordinates**'s viewport will be radially
///    evenly laid out between the maximum and minimum angles determined by
///    intersecting the viewport's main axis length with a cylinder whose
///    diameter is [diameterRatio] times longer, as long as those angles are
///    between -pi/2 and pi/2.
///
///    For example, if [diameterRatio] is 2.0 and this [RenderListWheelViewport]
///    is 100.0px in the main axis, then the diameter is 200.0. And children
///    will be evenly laid out between that cylinder's -arcsin(1/2) and
///    arcsin(1/2) angles.
///
///    The cylinder's 0 degree side is always centered in the
///    [RenderListWheelViewport]. The transformation from **untransformed
///    plane's viewport painting coordinates** is also done such that the child
///    in the center of that plane will be mostly untransformed with children
///    above and below it being transformed more as the angle increases.
