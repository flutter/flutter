  /// [AnnotatedRegionLayer] into the layer tree, or by adding the desired
  /// annotation by overriding [findAnnotations].
  /// {@endtemplate}
  ///
  /// ## Parameters and return value
  ///
  /// The [result] parameter is where the method outputs the resulting
  /// annotations. New annotations found during the walk are added to the tail.
  ///
  /// The [onlyFirst] parameter indicates that, if true, the search will stop
  /// when it finds the first qualified annotation; otherwise, it will walk the
  /// entire subtree.
  ///
  /// The return value indicates the opacity of this layer and its subtree at
  /// this position. If it returns true, then this layer's parent should skip
  /// the children behind this layer. In other words, it is opaque to this type
  /// of annotation and has absorbed the search so that its siblings behind it
  /// are not aware of the search. If the return value is false, then the parent
  /// might continue with other siblings.
  ///
  /// The return value does not affect whether the parent adds its own
  /// annotations; in other words, if a layer is supposed to add an annotation,
  /// it will always add it even if its children are opaque to this type of
  /// annotation. However, the opacity that the parents return might be affected

/// that integrates with host platform video player, camera, or OpenGL APIs,
