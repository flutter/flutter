/// Immutable layout constraints for [RenderBox] layout.
///
/// A [Size] respects a [BoxConstraints] if, and only if, all of the following
/// relations hold:
///
/// * [minWidth] <= [Size.width] <= [maxWidth]
/// * [minHeight] <= [Size.height] <= [maxHeight]
///
/// The constraints themselves must satisfy these relations:
///
/// * 0.0 <= [minWidth] <= [maxWidth] <= [double.infinity]
/// * 0.0 <= [minHeight] <= [maxHeight] <= [double.infinity]
///
/// [double.infinity] is a legal value for each constraint.
///
/// ## The box layout model
///
/// Render objects in the Flutter framework are laid out by a one-pass layout
/// model which walks down the render tree passing constraints, then walks back
/// up the render tree passing concrete geometry.
///
/// For boxes, the constraints are [BoxConstraints], which, as described herein,
/// consist of four numbers: a minimum width [minWidth], a maximum width
/// [maxWidth], a minimum height [minHeight], and a maximum height [maxHeight].
///
/// The geometry for boxes consists of a [Size], which must satisfy the
/// constraints described above.
///
/// Each [RenderBox] (the objects that provide the layout models for box
/// widgets) receives [BoxConstraints] from its parent, then lays out each of
/// its children, then picks a [Size] that satisfies the [BoxConstraints].
///
/// Render objects position their children independently of laying them out.
/// Frequently, the parent will use the children's sizes to determine their
/// position. A child does not know its position and will not necessarily be
/// laid out again, or repainted, if its position changes.
///
/// ## Terminology
///
/// When the minimum constraints and the maximum constraint in an axis are the
/// same, that axis is _tightly_ constrained. See: [
/// BoxConstraints.tightFor], [BoxConstraints.tightForFinite], [tighten],
/// [hasTightWidth], [hasTightHeight], [isTight].
///
/// An axis with a minimum constraint of 0.0 is _loose_ (regardless of the
/// maximum constraint; if it is also 0.0, then the axis is simultaneously tight
/// and loose!). See: [BoxConstraints.loose], [loosen].
///
/// An axis whose maximum constraint is not infinite is _bounded_. See:
/// [hasBoundedWidth], [hasBoundedHeight].
///
/// An axis whose maximum constraint is infinite is _unbounded_. An axis is
/// _expanding_ if it is tightly infinite (its minimum and maximum constraints
/// are both infinite). See: [BoxConstraints.expand].
///
/// An axis whose _minimum_ constraint is infinite is just said to be _infinite_
/// (since by definition the maximum constraint must also be infinite in that
/// case). See: [hasInfiniteWidth], [hasInfiniteHeight].
///
/// A size is _constrained_ when it satisfies a [BoxConstraints] description.
/// See: [constrain], [constrainWidth], [constrainHeight],
/// [constrainDimensions], [constrainSizeAndAttemptToPreserveAspectRatio],
/// [isSatisfiedBy].

/// A render object in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.

/// 0). The lower right corner of the box is therefore at (width, height). The
/// box contains all the points including the upper left corner and extending
/// to, but not including, the lower right corner.
///
/// Box layout is performed by passing a [BoxConstraints] object down the tree.
/// The box constraints establish a min and max value for the child's width and
/// height. In determining its size, the child must respect the constraints
/// given to it by its parent.
///
/// This protocol is sufficient for expressing a number of common box layout
/// data flows. For example, to implement a width-in-height-out data flow, call
/// your child's [layout] function with a set of box constraints with a tight
/// width value (and pass true for parentUsesSize). After the child determines
/// its height, use the child's height to determine your size.
///
/// ## Writing a RenderBox subclass
///
/// One would implement a new [RenderBox] subclass to describe a new layout
/// model, new paint model, new hit-testing model, or new semantics model, while
/// remaining in the Cartesian space defined by the [RenderBox] protocol.
///
/// To create a new protocol, consider subclassing [RenderObject] instead.
///
/// ### Constructors and properties of a new RenderBox subclass
///
/// The constructor will typically take a named argument for each property of
/// the class. The value is then passed to a private field of the class and the
/// constructor asserts its correctness (e.g. if it should not be null, it
/// asserts it's not null).
///
/// Properties have the form of a getter/setter/field group like the following:
///
/// ```dart
/// AxisDirection get axis => _axis;
/// AxisDirection _axis = AxisDirection.down; // or initialized in constructor
/// set axis(AxisDirection value) {
///   if (value == _axis) {
///     return;
///   }
///   _axis = value;
///   markNeedsLayout();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The setter will typically finish with either a call to [markNeedsLayout], if
/// the layout uses this property, or [markNeedsPaint], if only the painter
/// function does. (No need to call both, [markNeedsLayout] implies
/// [markNeedsPaint].)
///
/// Consider layout and paint to be expensive; be conservative about calling
/// [markNeedsLayout] or [markNeedsPaint]. They should only be called if the
/// layout (or paint, respectively) has actually changed.
///
/// ### Children
///
/// If a render object is a leaf, that is, it cannot have any children, then
/// ignore this section. (Examples of leaf render objects are [RenderImage] and
/// [RenderParagraph].)
///
/// For render objects with children, there are four possible scenarios:
///
/// * A single [RenderBox] child. In this scenario, consider inheriting from
///   [RenderProxyBox] (if the render object sizes itself to match the child) or
///   [RenderShiftedBox] (if the child will be smaller than the box and the box
///   will align the child inside itself).
///
/// * A single child, but it isn't a [RenderBox]. Use the
///   [RenderObjectWithChildMixin] mixin.
///
/// * A single list of children. Use the [ContainerRenderObjectMixin] mixin.
///
/// * A more complicated child model.
///
/// #### Using RenderProxyBox
///
/// By default, a [RenderProxyBox] render object sizes itself to fit its child, or
/// to be as small as possible if there is no child; it passes all hit testing
/// and painting on to the child, and intrinsic dimensions and baseline
/// measurements similarly are proxied to the child.
///
/// A subclass of [RenderProxyBox] just needs to override the parts of the
/// [RenderBox] protocol that matter. For example, [RenderOpacity] just
/// overrides the paint method (and [alwaysNeedsCompositing] to reflect what the
/// paint method does, and the [visitChildrenForSemantics] method so that the
/// child is hidden from accessibility tools when it's invisible), and adds an
/// [RenderOpacity.opacity] field.
///
/// [RenderProxyBox] assumes that the child is the size of the parent and
/// positioned at 0,0. If this is not true, then use [RenderShiftedBox] instead.
///
/// See
/// [proxy_box.dart](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/packages/flutter/lib/src/rendering/proxy_box.dart)
/// for examples of inheriting from [RenderProxyBox].
///
/// #### Using RenderShiftedBox
///
/// By default, a [RenderShiftedBox] acts much like a [RenderProxyBox] but
/// without assuming that the child is positioned at 0,0 (the actual position
/// recorded in the child's [parentData] field is used), and without providing a
/// default layout algorithm.
///
/// See
/// [shifted_box.dart](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/packages/flutter/lib/src/rendering/shifted_box.dart)
/// for examples of inheriting from [RenderShiftedBox].
///
/// #### Kinds of children and child-specific data
///
/// A [RenderBox] doesn't have to have [RenderBox] children. One can use another
/// subclass of [RenderObject] for a [RenderBox]'s children. See the discussion
/// at [RenderObject].
///
/// Children can have additional data owned by the parent but stored on the
/// child using the [parentData] field. The class used for that data must
/// inherit from [ParentData]. The [setupParentData] method is used to
/// initialize the [parentData] field of a child when the child is attached.
///
/// By convention, [RenderBox] objects that have [RenderBox] children use the
/// [BoxParentData] class, which has a [BoxParentData.offset] field to store the
/// position of the child relative to the parent. ([RenderProxyBox] does not
/// need this offset and therefore is an exception to this rule.)
///
/// #### Using RenderObjectWithChildMixin
///
/// If a render object has a single child but it isn't a [RenderBox], then the
/// [RenderObjectWithChildMixin] class, which is a mixin that will handle the
/// boilerplate of managing a child, will be useful.
///
/// It's a generic class with one type argument, the type of the child. For
/// example, if you are building a `RenderFoo` class which takes a single
/// `RenderBar` child, you would use the mixin as follows:
///
/// ```dart
/// class RenderFoo extends RenderBox
///   with RenderObjectWithChildMixin<RenderBar> {
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Since the `RenderFoo` class itself is still a [RenderBox] in this case, you
/// still have to implement the [RenderBox] layout algorithm, as well as
/// features like intrinsics and baselines, painting, and hit testing.
///
/// #### Using ContainerRenderObjectMixin
///
/// If a render box can have multiple children, then the
/// [ContainerRenderObjectMixin] mixin can be used to handle the boilerplate. It
/// uses a linked list to model the children in a manner that is easy to mutate
/// dynamically and that can be walked efficiently. Random access is not
/// efficient in this model; if you need random access to the children consider
/// the next section on more complicated child models.
///
/// The [ContainerRenderObjectMixin] class has two type arguments. The first is
/// the type of the child objects. The second is the type for their
/// [parentData]. The class used for [parentData] must itself have the
/// [ContainerParentDataMixin] class mixed into it; this is where
/// [ContainerRenderObjectMixin] stores the linked list. A [ParentData] class
/// can extend [ContainerBoxParentData]; this is essentially
/// [BoxParentData] mixed with [ContainerParentDataMixin]. For example, if a
/// `RenderFoo` class wanted to have a linked list of [RenderBox] children, one
/// might create a `FooParentData` class as follows:
///
/// ```dart
/// class FooParentData extends ContainerBoxParentData<RenderBox> {
///   // (any fields you might need for these children)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When using [ContainerRenderObjectMixin] in a [RenderBox], consider mixing in
/// [RenderBoxContainerDefaultsMixin], which provides a collection of utility
/// methods that implement common parts of the [RenderBox] protocol (such as
/// painting the children).
///
/// The declaration of the `RenderFoo` class itself would thus look like this:
///
/// ```dart
/// // continuing from previous example...
/// class RenderFoo extends RenderBox with
///   ContainerRenderObjectMixin<RenderBox, FooParentData>,
///   RenderBoxContainerDefaultsMixin<RenderBox, FooParentData> {
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When walking the children (e.g. during layout), the following pattern is
/// commonly used (in this case assuming that the children are all [RenderBox]
/// objects and that this render object uses `FooParentData` objects for its
/// children's [parentData] fields):
///
/// ```dart
/// // continuing from previous example...
/// RenderBox? child = firstChild;
/// while (child != null) {
///   final FooParentData childParentData = child.parentData! as FooParentData;
///   // ...operate on child and childParentData...
///   assert(child.parentData == childParentData);
///   child = childParentData.nextSibling;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// #### More complicated child models
///
/// Render objects can have more complicated models, for example a map of
/// children keyed on an enum, or a 2D grid of efficiently randomly-accessible
/// children, or multiple lists of children, etc. If a render object has a model
/// that can't be handled by the mixins above, it must implement the
/// [RenderObject] child protocol, as follows:
///
/// * Any time a child is removed, call [dropChild] with the child.
///
/// * Any time a child is added, call [adoptChild] with the child.
///
/// * Implement the [attach] method such that it calls [attach] on each child.
///
/// * Implement the [detach] method such that it calls [detach] on each child.
///
/// * Implement the [redepthChildren] method such that it calls [redepthChild]
///   on each child.
///
/// * Implement the [visitChildren] method such that it calls its argument for
///   each child, typically in paint order (back-most to front-most).
///
/// * Implement [debugDescribeChildren] such that it outputs a [DiagnosticsNode]
///   for each child.
///
/// Implementing these seven bullet points is essentially all that the two
/// aforementioned mixins do.
///
/// ### Layout
///
/// [RenderBox] classes implement a layout algorithm. They have a set of
/// constraints provided to them, and they size themselves based on those
/// constraints and whatever other inputs they may have (for example, their
/// children or properties).
///
/// When implementing a [RenderBox] subclass, one must make a choice. Does it
/// size itself exclusively based on the constraints, or does it use any other
/// information in sizing itself? An example of sizing purely based on the
/// constraints would be growing to fit the parent.
///
/// Sizing purely based on the constraints allows the system to make some
/// significant optimizations. Classes that use this approach should override
/// [sizedByParent] to return true, and then override [computeDryLayout] to
/// compute the [Size] using nothing but the constraints, e.g.:
///
/// ```dart
/// @override
/// bool get sizedByParent => true;
///
/// @override
/// Size computeDryLayout(BoxConstraints constraints) {
///   return constraints.smallest;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Otherwise, the size is set in the [performLayout] function.
///
/// The [performLayout] function is where render boxes decide, if they are not
/// [sizedByParent], what [size] they should be, and also where they decide
/// where their children should be.
///
/// #### Layout of RenderBox children
///
/// The [performLayout] function should call the [layout] function of each (box)
/// child, passing it a [BoxConstraints] object describing the constraints
/// within which the child can render. Passing tight constraints (see
/// [BoxConstraints.isTight]) to the child will allow the rendering library to
/// apply some optimizations, as it knows that if the constraints are tight, the
/// child's dimensions cannot change even if the layout of the child itself
/// changes.
///
/// If the [performLayout] function will use the child's size to affect other
/// aspects of the layout, for example if the render box sizes itself around the
/// child, or positions several children based on the size of those children,
/// then it must specify the `parentUsesSize` argument to the child's [layout]
/// function, setting it to true.
///
/// This flag turns off some optimizations; algorithms that do not rely on the
/// children's sizes will be more efficient. (In particular, relying on the
/// child's [size] means that if the child is marked dirty for layout, the
/// parent will probably also be marked dirty for layout, unless the
/// [constraints] given by the parent to the child were tight constraints.)
///
/// For [RenderBox] classes that do not inherit from [RenderProxyBox], once they
/// have laid out their children, they should also position them, by setting the
/// [BoxParentData.offset] field of each child's [parentData] object.
///
/// #### Layout of non-RenderBox children
///
/// The children of a [RenderBox] do not have to be [RenderBox]es themselves. If
/// they use another protocol (as discussed at [RenderObject]), then instead of
/// [BoxConstraints], the parent would pass in the appropriate [Constraints]
/// subclass, and instead of reading the child's size, the parent would read
/// whatever the output of [layout] is for that layout protocol. The
/// `parentUsesSize` flag is still used to indicate whether the parent is going
/// to read that output, and optimizations still kick in if the child has tight
/// constraints (as defined by [Constraints.isTight]).
///
/// ### Painting
///
/// To describe how a render box paints, implement the [paint] method. It is
/// given a [PaintingContext] object and an [Offset]. The painting context
/// provides methods to affect the layer tree as well as a
/// [PaintingContext.canvas] which can be used to add drawing commands. The
/// canvas object should not be cached across calls to the [PaintingContext]'s
/// methods; every time a method on [PaintingContext] is called, there is a
/// chance that the canvas will change identity. The offset specifies the
/// position of the top left corner of the box in the coordinate system of the
/// [PaintingContext.canvas].
///
/// To draw text on a canvas, use a [TextPainter].
///
/// To draw an image to a canvas, use the [paintImage] method.
///
/// A [RenderBox] that uses methods on [PaintingContext] that introduce new
/// layers should override the [alwaysNeedsCompositing] getter and set it to
/// true. If the object sometimes does and sometimes does not, it can have that
/// getter return true in some cases and false in others. In that case, whenever
/// the return value would change, call [markNeedsCompositingBitsUpdate]. (This
/// is done automatically when a child is added or removed, so you don't have to
/// call it explicitly if the [alwaysNeedsCompositing] getter only changes value
/// based on the presence or absence of children.)
///
/// Anytime anything changes on the object that would cause the [paint] method
/// to paint something different (but would not cause the layout to change),
/// the object should call [markNeedsPaint].
///
/// #### Painting children
///
/// The [paint] method's `context` argument has a [PaintingContext.paintChild]
/// method, which should be called for each child that is to be painted. It
/// should be given a reference to the child, and an [Offset] giving the
/// position of the child relative to the parent.
///
/// If the [paint] method applies a transform to the painting context before
/// painting children (or generally applies an additional offset beyond the
/// offset it was itself given as an argument), then the [applyPaintTransform]
/// method should also be overridden. That method must adjust the matrix that it
/// is given in the same manner as it transformed the painting context and
/// offset before painting the given child. This is used by the [globalToLocal]
/// and [localToGlobal] methods.
///
/// #### Hit Tests
///
/// Hit testing for render boxes is implemented by the [hitTest] method. The
/// default implementation of this method defers to [hitTestSelf] and
/// [hitTestChildren]. When implementing hit testing, you can either override
/// these latter two methods, or ignore them and just override [hitTest].
///
/// The [hitTest] method itself is given an [Offset], and must return true if the
/// object or one of its children has absorbed the hit (preventing objects below
/// this one from being hit), or false if the hit can continue to other objects
/// below this one.
///
/// For each child [RenderBox], the [hitTest] method on the child should be
/// called with the same [HitTestResult] argument and with the point transformed
/// into the child's coordinate space (in the same manner that the
/// [applyPaintTransform] method would). The default implementation defers to
/// [hitTestChildren] to call the children. [RenderBoxContainerDefaultsMixin]
/// provides a [RenderBoxContainerDefaultsMixin.defaultHitTestChildren] method
/// that does this assuming that the children are axis-aligned, not transformed,
/// and positioned according to the [BoxParentData.offset] field of the
/// [parentData]; more elaborate boxes can override [hitTestChildren]
/// accordingly.
///
/// If the object is hit, then it should also add itself to the [HitTestResult]
/// object that is given as an argument to the [hitTest] method, using
/// [HitTestResult.add]. The default implementation defers to [hitTestSelf] to
/// determine if the box is hit. If the object adds itself before the children
/// can add themselves, then it will be as if the object was above the children.
/// If it adds itself after the children, then it will be as if it was below the
/// children. Entries added to the [HitTestResult] object should use the
/// [BoxHitTestEntry] class. The entries are subsequently walked by the system
/// in the order they were added, and for each entry, the target's [handleEvent]
/// method is called, passing in the [HitTestEntry] object.
///
/// Hit testing cannot rely on painting having happened.
///
/// ### Semantics
///
/// For a render box to be accessible, implement the
/// [describeApproximatePaintClip], [visitChildrenForSemantics], and
/// [describeSemanticsConfiguration] methods. The default implementations are
/// sufficient for objects that only affect layout, but nodes that represent
/// interactive components or information (diagrams, text, images, etc) should
/// provide more complete implementations. For more information, see the
/// documentation for these members.
///
/// ### Intrinsics and Baselines
///
/// The layout, painting, hit testing, and semantics protocols are common to all
/// render objects. [RenderBox] objects must implement two additional protocols:
/// intrinsic sizing and baseline measurements.
///
/// There are four methods to implement for intrinsic sizing, to compute the
/// minimum and maximum intrinsic width and height of the box. The documentation
/// for these methods discusses the protocol in detail:
/// [computeMinIntrinsicWidth], [computeMaxIntrinsicWidth],
/// [computeMinIntrinsicHeight], [computeMaxIntrinsicHeight].
///
/// Be sure to set [debugCheckIntrinsicSizes] to true in your unit tests if you
/// do override any of these methods, which will add additional checks to
/// help validate your implementation.
///
/// In addition, if the box has any children, it must implement
/// [computeDistanceToActualBaseline]. [RenderProxyBox] provides a simple
/// implementation that forwards to the child; [RenderShiftedBox] provides an
/// implementation that offsets the child's baseline information by the position
/// of the child relative to the parent. If you do not inherited from either of
/// these classes, however, you must implement the algorithm yourself.

  ///
  /// Be sure to set [debugCheckIntrinsicSizes] to true in your unit tests if

  ///
  /// ## Examples
  ///
  /// ### Text
  ///
  /// English text is the canonical example of a width-in-height-out algorithm.
  /// The `height` argument is therefore ignored.
  ///
  /// Consider the string "Hello World". The _maximum_ intrinsic width (as
  /// returned from [computeMaxIntrinsicWidth]) would be the width of the string
  /// with no line breaks.
  ///
  /// The minimum intrinsic width would be the width of the widest word, "Hello"
  /// or "World". If the text is rendered in an even narrower width, however, it
  /// might still not overflow. For example, maybe the rendering would put a
  /// line-break half-way through the words, as in "Hel⁞lo⁞Wor⁞ld". However,
  /// this wouldn't be a _correct_ rendering, and [computeMinIntrinsicWidth] is
  /// defined as returning the minimum width that the box could be without
  /// failing to _correctly_ paint the contents within itself.
  ///
  /// The minimum intrinsic _height_ for a given width _smaller_ than the
  /// minimum intrinsic width could therefore be greater than the minimum
  /// intrinsic height for the minimum intrinsic width.
  ///
  /// ### Viewports (e.g. scrolling lists)
  ///
  /// Some render boxes are intended to clip their children. For example, the
  /// render box for a scrolling list might always size itself to its parents'
  /// size (or rather, to the maximum incoming constraints), regardless of the
  /// children's sizes, and then clip the children and position them based on
  /// the current scroll offset.
  ///
  /// The intrinsic dimensions in these cases still depend on the children, even
  /// though the layout algorithm sizes the box in a way independent of the
  /// children. It is the size that is needed to paint the box's contents (in
  /// this case, the children) _without clipping_ that matters.
  ///
  /// ### When the intrinsic dimensions cannot be known
  ///
  /// There are cases where render objects do not have an efficient way to
  /// compute their intrinsic dimensions. For example, it may be prohibitively
  /// expensive to reify and measure every child of a lazy viewport (viewports
  /// generally only instantiate the actually visible children), or the
  /// dimensions may be computed by a callback about which the render object
  /// cannot reason.
  ///
  /// In such cases, it may be impossible (or at least impractical) to actually
  /// return a valid answer. In such cases, the intrinsic functions should throw
  /// when [RenderObject.debugCheckingIntrinsics] is false and asserts are
  /// enabled, and return 0.0 otherwise.
  ///
  /// See the implementations of [LayoutBuilder] or [RenderViewportBase] for
  /// examples (in particular,
  /// [RenderViewportBase.debugThrowIfNotCheckingIntrinsics]).
  ///
  /// ### Aspect-ratio-driven boxes
  ///
  /// Some boxes always return a fixed size based on the constraints. For these
  /// boxes, the intrinsic functions should return the appropriate size when the
  /// incoming `height` or `width` argument is finite, treating that as a tight
  /// constraint in the respective direction and treating the other direction's
  /// constraints as unbounded. This is because the definitions of
  /// [computeMinIntrinsicWidth] and [computeMinIntrinsicHeight] are in terms of
  /// what the dimensions _could be_, and such boxes can only be one size in
  /// such cases.
  ///
  /// When the incoming argument is not finite, then they should return the
  /// actual intrinsic dimensions based on the contents, as any other box would.
  ///
