/// The interface used by [CustomPaint] (in the widgets library) and
/// [RenderCustomPaint] (in the rendering library).
///
/// To implement a custom painter, either subclass or implement this interface
/// to define your custom paint delegate. [CustomPaint] subclasses must
/// implement the [paint] and [shouldRepaint] methods, and may optionally also
/// implement the [hitTest] and [shouldRebuildSemantics] methods, and the
/// [semanticsBuilder] getter.
///
/// The [paint] method is called whenever the custom object needs to be repainted.

/// The [shouldRepaint] method is called when a new instance of the class

/// information.
///
/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvI_NUXK00s}
///
/// The most efficient way to trigger a repaint is to either:
///
/// * Extend this class and supply a `repaint` argument to the constructor of
///   the [CustomPainter], where that object notifies its listeners when it is
///   time to repaint.
/// * Extend [Listenable] (e.g. via [ChangeNotifier]) and implement
///   [CustomPainter], so that the object itself provides the notifications
///   directly.
///
/// In either case, the [CustomPaint] widget or [RenderCustomPaint]
/// render object will listen to the [Listenable] and repaint whenever the
/// animation ticks, avoiding both the build and layout phases of the pipeline.
///
/// The [hitTest] method is called when the user interacts with the underlying
/// render object, to determine if the user hit the object or missed it.
///
/// The [semanticsBuilder] is called whenever the custom object needs to rebuild
/// its semantics information.
///
/// The [shouldRebuildSemantics] method is called when a new instance of the
/// class is provided, to check if the new instance contains different
/// information that affects the semantics tree.
