/// ## Layout algorithm
///
/// _This section describes how the framework causes [RenderFlex] to position
/// its children._
/// _See [BoxConstraints] for an introduction to box layout models._
///
/// Layout for a [RenderFlex] proceeds in six steps:
///
/// 1. Layout each child a null or zero flex factor with unbounded main axis
///    constraints and the incoming cross axis constraints. If the
///    [crossAxisAlignment] is [CrossAxisAlignment.stretch], instead use tight
///    cross axis constraints that match the incoming max extent in the cross
///    axis.
/// 2. Divide the remaining main axis space among the children with non-zero
///    flex factors according to their flex factor. For example, a child with a
///    flex factor of 2.0 will receive twice the amount of main axis space as a
///    child with a flex factor of 1.0.
/// 3. Layout each of the remaining children with the same cross axis
///    constraints as in step 1, but instead of using unbounded main axis
///    constraints, use max axis constraints based on the amount of space
///    allocated in step 2. Children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.tight] are given tight constraints (i.e., forced to fill the
///    allocated space), and children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.loose] are given loose constraints (i.e., not forced to fill the
///    allocated space).
/// 4. The cross axis extent of the [RenderFlex] is the maximum cross axis
///    extent of the children (which will always satisfy the incoming
///    constraints).
/// 5. The main axis extent of the [RenderFlex] is determined by the
///    [mainAxisSize] property. If the [mainAxisSize] property is
///    [MainAxisSize.max], then the main axis extent of the [RenderFlex] is the
///    max extent of the incoming main axis constraints. If the [mainAxisSize]
///    property is [MainAxisSize.min], then the main axis extent of the [Flex]
///    is the sum of the main axis extents of the children (subject to the
///    incoming constraints).
/// 6. Determine the position for each child according to the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] and the [crossAxisAlignment]. For example, if the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] is [MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween], any main axis
///    space that has not been allocated to children is divided evenly and
///    placed between the children.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Flex], the widget equivalent.
///  * [Row] and [Column], direction-specific variants of [Flex].
