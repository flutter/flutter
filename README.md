Flutter
=======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/flutter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/flutter)

Flutter is a new way to build high-performance, cross-platform mobile apps.
Flutter is optimized for today's, and tomorrow's, mobile devices. We are
focused on low-latency input and high frame rates on Android and iOS.

_Flutter is an early-stage open-source project._ We are still missing core
features like accessibility, text input, localization, and more. However,
you can build demos and examples today. We hope you try it out and send
us [feedback](mailto:flutter-dev@googlegroups.com).

 - For information about using Flutter to build apps, please see
   the [getting started guide](http://flutter.io/getting-started/).
