Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user experiences for
mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing
code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and
open source.

## Documentation

* [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/get-started/)
* [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
* [Development wiki](./docs/README.md)
* [Contributing to Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

For announcements about new releases, follow the
[flutter-announce@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-announce)
mailing list. Our documentation also tracks [breaking
changes](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes) across releases.

## Terms of service

The Flutter tool may occasionally download resources from Google servers. By
downloading or using the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of Service:
https://policies.google.com/terms

For example, when installed from GitHub (as opposed to from a prepackaged
archive), the Flutter tool will download the Dart SDK from Google servers
immediately when first run, as it is used to execute the `flutter` tool itself.
This will also occur when Flutter is upgraded (e.g. by running the `flutter
upgrade` command).

## About Flutter

We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model, whether you're targeting iOS or Android,
web, Windows, macOS, Linux or embedding it as the UI toolkit for a platform of
your choice.

### Beautiful user experiences

We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
Flutter's [layered architecture] gives you control over every pixel on the
screen and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate
graphics, video, text, and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full
[set of widgets][widget catalog] that deliver pixel-perfect experiences whether
you're building for iOS ([Cupertino]) or other platforms ([Material]), along with
support for customizing or creating entirely new visual components.

### Fast results

Flutter is fast. It's powered by hardware-accelerated 2D graphics
libraries like [Skia] (which underpins Chrome and Android) and
[Impeller]. We architected Flutter to
support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.

Flutter code is powered by the world-class [Dart platform], which enables
compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android,
JavaScript and WebAssembly for the web, as well as Intel x64 and ARM
for desktop devices.

### Productive development

Flutter offers [stateful hot reload][Hot reload], allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.

### Extensible and open model

Flutter works with any development tool (or none at all), and also includes
editor plug-ins for both [Visual Studio Code] and [IntelliJ / Android Studio].
Flutter provides [tens of thousands of packages][Flutter packages] to speed your
development, regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code
is easy, with support for both FFI ([on Android][Android FFI], [on iOS][iOS FFI],
[on macOS][macOS FFI], and [on Windows][Windows FFI]) as well as
[platform-specific APIs][platform channels].

Flutter is a fully open-source project, and we welcome contributions.
Information on how to get started can be found in our
[contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
