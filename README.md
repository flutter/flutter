Flutter Engine
==============
[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/flutter/engine.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/flutter/engine)

Flutter is a new way to build high-performance, cross-platform mobile apps.
Flutter is optimized for today's, and tomorrow's, mobile devices. We are
focused on low-latency input and high frame rates on Android and iOS.

The Flutter Engine is a portable runtime for hosting
[Flutter](https://flutter.io) applications.  It implements Flutter's core
libraries, including animation and graphics, file and network I/O,
accessibility support, plugin architecture, and a Dart runtime and compile
toolchain. Most developers will interact with Flutter via the [Flutter
Framework](https://github.com/flutter/flutter), which provides a modern,
reactive framework, and a rich set of platform, layout and foundation widgets.

If you are new to Flutter, then you will find more general information
on the Flutter project, including tutorials and samples, on our Web
site at [flutter.io](https://flutter.io). For specific information
about Flutter's APIs, consider our API reference which can be found at
the [docs.flutter.io](https://docs.flutter.io/).
